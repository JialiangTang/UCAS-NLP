IRAQ AND ANNOUNCED WITHOUT WARNING  ENERGY WHETHER GAS PRICES ARE UP OR DOWN DONT BLAME OR THANK THE PRESIDENTIT WAS A MASSIVE SURPRISE TO EVERYBODY IN THE MARKET SAYS JORGE LEON  A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT RYSTAD ENERGY  HERES WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THESE CUTS  OIL MARKETS HAVE RESPONDED WITH A PRICE JUMP  BRENT PRICES THE GLOBAL BENCHMARK JUMPED UP AROUND  TO AROUND  A BARREL IMMEDIATELY ON NEWS OF THE CUTS REDUCING OIL PRODUCTION MEANS LESS SUPPLY ON THE MARKET WHICH OBVIOUSLY PUSHES PRICES HIGHER  BECAUSE THE CUTS ARE PLANNED TO LAST FROM MAY THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR THE EFFECT ON OIL PRICES IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE PROLONGED OVERALL WE THINK THAT OIL PRICE SAYS MIGHT INCREASE BY AROUND  GOING FORWARD COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAD SAYS LEON OF RYSTAD ENERGY THATS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT  CRUDE PRICES DROPPED SHARPLY LAST MONTH DRIVEN BY THE TURMOIL IN THE BANKING SECTOR THAT HURT THE BUDGETS OF COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA WHICH RELY ON OIL REVENUE AND CUTTING PRODUCTION WAS A RELIABLE WAY TO BRING PRICES BACK UP  FOR THE RECORD SAUDI ARABIA SAID THE CUTS WERE A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AIMED AT SUPPORTING THE STABILITY OF THE OIL MARKET THE KINGDOM CONSISTENTLY DENIES THAT PRODUCTION DECISIONS ARE MADE WITH A SPECIFIC PRICE TARGET IN MIND  HOWEVER OIL ANALYSTS INTERPRETED THE SURPRISE PRODUCTION CUTS AS A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT SAUDI ARABIA AND CLOSE

CERTAINLY DIDNT EVERY TURN WE MADE WAS A SURPRISE TO ME I DONT KNOW ABOUT THE OTHERS BUT FOR ME I NEVER KNEW WHERE THIS THING WAS GOING MICHAEL LACHOWSKI WELL I DEFINITELY THINK IT EVOLVED THAT SENSE OF EVOLUTION WAS BUILT INTO OUR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WE WERE FIGURING OUT WHO ELSE NEEDED TO BE INVOLVED OF COURSE THE DYNAMIC CHANGED ALONG THE WAY AS SOON AS WE ADDED CURTIS AND THEN LATER ON VANESSA ANOTHER BIG ONE I THINK WAS THAT A LOT OF OUR REALLY CLOSE FRIENDS THEY WERE EAGER TO SEE US AND SEE US DO WELL BUT WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WOULD JUST LIKE STRAIGHT UP COME AND TELL US YALL ARE DOING SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING BUT YOU NEED TO DO THIS YOU NEED TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK HAPPIER ON STAGE OR YOU NEED TO MOVE AROUND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ANOTHER WAY THAT IT EVOLVED WAS JUST BY DINT OF REPETITION WE DID BECOME A LOT MORE CONFIDENT IN OUR INSTRUMENTS AND THE ROLES THAT WE PLAYED WITHIN THE BAND WE DIDNT HAVE POINT A THAT WE STARTED FROM AND A DESTINATION THAT WE WERE WORKING TOWARDS BY ANY MEANS IT REALLY UNFOLDED WE REALLY BUILT UPON OUR OWN CREATIONS  I FOUND A SCAN OF NEW YORK ROCKERS PROFILE FROM  AND THERES A MOMENT IN THE INTERVIEW WHERE CURTIS ADMITS TO TAKING INSPIRATION FROM A GANG OF FOUR BEAT AND MICHAELS PUT OFF BY IT BUT IN A FUNNY WAY IT BOTHERS ME THAT IT WAS CONSCIOUSLY YOUR INSPIRATION A GUY WITH NO HAIR  CROWE NOW I HAVE NO HAIR SO WERE EVEN EVERYONE LAUGHS WITH SOME BANDS THEIR INFLUENCES ARE CLEAR BUT WITH OTHERS ITS MORE OBSCURED THE SOUNDS THEY GREW UP ON THE SCENE THEYRE A PART OF THE BOOKS THEY READ  IT TURNS INTO A MULTIDIMENSIONAL

GAVE IT TO ME I WOULD TAKE IT BUT I NEVER REALLY BOUGHT THEM AND SO I WAS LIVING IN THE LOFT UP FROM THE STUDIO WHERE MICHAEL AND RANDY WERE STARTING TO PRACTICE AND I HAD A LITTLE ONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW THE RECORD PLAYER WHERE YOU TOOK DOWN THE TURNTABLE AND THE SPEAKERS CAME OUT I DONT KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM AND I THINK I HAD FOUR OR FIVE RECORDS UP THERE NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS WAS ON HEAVY ROTATION I HAD A LOU RAWLS RECORD I WAS LISTENING TO AND I WAS LISTENING TO A LOT OF IGGY POPS RAW POWER  I LOVE THAT RECORD I HAD A REALLY LIMITED LITTLE RANGE OF THINGS THAT IT WAS REALLY ANYTHING THAT WAS IN MY PERIPHERY THAT I JUST I WOULD LATCH ONTO AND I WOULD JUST LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I WASNT TERRIBLY SELECTIVE  SO IT WAS GREAT WHEN I HOOKED UP WITH ANYBODY ELSE I WAS ALWAYS JUST GLOMMING ON THEIR MUSIC MICHAEL TURNED ME ON TO KRAFTWERK AND ALL OF THOSE MACHINELIKE BANDS AND THAT WAS JUST SUPER EXCITING TO ME BECAUSE THATS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO  I ALWAYS ENVISIONED MYSELF AS PART OF A MACHINE I ALWAYS FIGURED I WAS JUST LIKE AN ENGINE OR SOMETHING THATS WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT PLAYING MUSIC JUST BEING PART OF THAT MACHINE LACHOWSKI I WAS A MAJOR MUSIC CONSUMER STARTING WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE LIKE ALL OF US I GREW UP IN SUBURBAN ATLANTA SO I HAD WREK I HAD FM RADIO BUT I MOSTLY BOUGHT ALBUMS JUST BASED ON THE STICKERS ON THE RECORD OR THE GRAPHICS OR THE NAMES THAT PROCESS STARTED TO RUN A LITTLE BIT DRY AROUND THE TIME THAT I WAS IN COLLEGE I STARTED REALIZING THAT I DIDNT KNOW WHERE TO GO AND LOST MY THREAD ABOUT WHERE TO GET MY CUES I FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF MY PEERS WERE PICKING UP ON A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT I MISSED LIKE VELVET UNDERGROUND OR STUFF FROM THAT SCENE IN NEW YORK  AROUND THE TIME THAT RANDY AND I BECAME ROOMMATES WE WOULDNT DUPLICATE OUR PURCHASES FOR THE MOST PART EXCEPT THAT WE DIDNT SPEND OUR SUMMERS TOGETHER SO SOMETIMES I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A RECORD THAT I KNEW HE HAD ALREADY BOUGHT BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO WAIT TILL SEPTEMBER TO HEAR IT OR WHATEVER  RANDY AND I SHARED THE BULK OF WHAT WE LOVED RAMONES GANG OF FOUR DEFINITELY KRAFTWERK PERE UBU WE WERE REALLY INTO XTC MAYBE HIM MORE THAN ME KILLING JOKE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE WILLING TO BUY AND OWN STUFF LIKE BLONDIE JOE JACKSON YOU KNOW ELVIS COSTELLO MAYBE MAYBE EVEN THE KNACK I DONT REMEMBER AND THEN I WAS OVER ON THE SIDE OF LIKE DAF CABARET VOLTAIRE THE MEKONS SUICIDE STRANGLERS I PROBABLY LIKED SUICIDE MORE THAN KRAFTWERK PRACTICALLY JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF IT  FRIENDS WOULD BRING OVER A PACK AND A NEW RECORD LIKE THE FLYING LIZARDS OR A NEW DEVO RECORD AND THE FOUR OF US JUST SAT AROUND AND LISTENED TO A RECORD LIKE SEVEN OR  TIMES OH TELEVISION TELEVISION GOTTA INCLUDE THEM CROWE THERE WERE LITTLE DROPS THAT CAME OUT LITTLE RAINDROPS OF NEW RECORDS THESE S WOULD LAND LIKE THEY CAME FROM OUTER SPACE AND WE WOULD JUST TAKE THESE ARTIFACTS AND PLAY THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL WE JUST COMPLETELY MEMORIZED EVERY INSTANCE OF THAT SONG AND WHEN A NEW ONE CAME IN WE WOULD ABSORB THAT ONE AND IM SURE EVERY ONE OF THOSE THERES SOME PIECE OF DNA FROM EVERY ONE OF THOSE SONGS THAT ENDED UP THEREYOUTUBE RAZZ TAPE IS A REAL PEAK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF WHAT PYLON WAS BEFORE GYRATE TELL ME THE STORY BEHIND THIS SESSION THERE ARE SOME SONGS ON HERE THAT NEVER APPEARED ON LATER RECORDS WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM  HAY CHRIS RAZZ WANTED TO RECORD US HED RECORDED US AT CHAPTER THREE OR AT A PARTY OR SOMETHING HE WAS JUST A NUT ABOUT WANTING TO RECORD THINGS AND SO WE SAID SURE I DONT REMEMBER THAT WE EVER USED THIS FOR ANYTHING BUT IT WAS LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL BECAUSE IT WAS SO WARM I REMEMBER THAT  I WAS SET UP IN THE HALL OUTSIDE OF WHERE MICHAEL AND CURTIS AND RANDY WERE AND HE KEPT THE TAPE MACHINE IN THE HALL WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF MICHAEL IN MY STUDIO AND IT WAS ALSO THE BANDS PRACTICE SPACE HE SET THE MIC UP FOR ME IN THE HALL THERE WERE TWO MICS IN THE ROOM ONE WAS FOR THE DRUMS AND THE OTHER MIC WAS SHARED BY BOTH THE BASS AND THE GUITAR YALL COULDNT SEE ME I COULDNT SEE YOU  WE HAD SOME SONGS THAT WE WERE TRYING OUT THAT WERE VERY RECENTLY WRITTEN READ A BOOK HAS THE INSTRUMENTAL VERSION I HADNT WRITTEN THE LYRICS FOR IT YET AND WED JUST WRITTEN COOL WE JUST WENT THROUGH IT WE JUST PLOWED THROUGH IT ITS NOT OVERDUBBED BUT THATS JUST WHAT IT IS AND I CRINGE AT SOME OF THE THINGS BUT THE OVERALL SOUND AND FEELING OF IT IS VERY SPONTANEOUS ITS A BEAUTIFUL RECORD JUST BECAUSE OF THAT AND OF COURSE WE THREW OUT A BUNCH OF THOSE SONGS AND THEY WERE NEVER RECORDED  LACHOWSKI I THINK THAT CHRIS WAS SUCH A MUSIC NERD HE STILL IS HES WORKED IN OR OWNED A RECORD STORE AND BEEN A COLLECTOR HE WAS SO INFLUENTIAL ON WHAT RANDY AND I WOULD BUY AT THE STORE AND PROBABLY EVERYONE ELSE AT CHAPTER THREE RECORDS THEN HE BOUGHT THIS AMAZING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY EDITORS NOTE A REVOX TAPE RECORDER AND A NAKAMICHI CASSETTE DECK AND THEN ONCE YOU OWN THAT YOU JUST GOT TO GO FIND A USE FOR IT YOUVE GOT TO GO OUT AND RECORD THE SAME CASSETTE THAT WERE CALLING RAZZ TAPE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TAPE IS HIS RECORDING OF PUBLIC IMAGE LTD JUST THE FACT THAT YOU WOULDNT START WITH A FRESH TAPE FOR PUBLIC IMAGE LTD ITS FLAWED BUT IT CAPTURES THE ENERGY OF THOSE SONGS AND THE WAY THAT BEFORE WE GOT COMPETENT TO THE POINT OF BECOMING MORE MANNEREDYOUTUBE WHAT WAS X THE PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED SONG FEATURED ON EXTRA ITS GOT SUCH A CLIPPED RAW GROOVE  CROWE X IS CLIPPED AND RAW BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE DID STARTED THAT WAY IT USUALLY STARTED WITH RANDY HE WOULD INTRODUCE A RIFF I WOULD BUILD A BEAT AND MICHAEL WOULD FIND A GROOVE IT WAS ALWAYS DONE IN REAL TIME WITH BARELY THREE OR FOUR MEASURES BEFORE WE HAD THE BONES OF THE SONG FULLY FORMED IT REALLY WAS A RAPID PROTOTYPING STYLE VANESSA WOULD SOMETIMES PROVIDE INSTANT VOCALS BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HAD A LITTLE MORE TIME TO CONSIDER HER PARTS STRUCTURE WAS AN EVOLUTIONARY CONSIDERATION  EACH MEMBER OF PYLON WAS CRUCIAL TO THE WHOLE BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT RANDYS GUITAR PLAYING ON GYRATE HE WAS A SHARP FOIL TO VANESSAS VOICE BUT BY THE TIME YALL GOT TO CHOMP HIS PLAYING BECAME MORE SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL SO MUCH OF EARLY PYLON WAS ABOUT THE INSTANTANEOUSNESS OF THE MUSIC WHEN AND WHY DID THAT CHANGE WAS RANDYS GUITAR PLAYING PART OF THAT OR WAS THE BAND STARTING TO UNDERSTAND ITSELF MORE CROWE I GOT AN IDEA HERE RANDY WAS THE DRUMMER UNTIL I CAME DOWN AND SO HE PICKED UP THE GUITAR AND HE PLAYED THE GUITAR LIKE THE DRUMS HE AND I WOULD REALLY MATCH BEAT FOR BEAT I REALLY KEYED OFF OF RANDYS GUITAR PLAYING AS A PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENT I THINK HE WAS A DRUMMER UNTIL HE JUST NATURALLY EVOLVED INTO BEING A GUITAR PLAYER HE STARTED UNDERSTANDING HOW THE GUITAR WORKED HE EXPANDED THE VOCABULARY   ALL SONGS CONSIDERED PYLONS FINAL SHOW FROM  IS AN EPIPHANYLACHOWSKI IVE ALWAYS BEEN AMAZED AT THE SOUNDS HE MADE WITH HIS GUITAR THIS UNTITLED SONG THAT WE HAVE THAT PREDATES WHEN VANESSA WAS IN PYLON THATS ON THE RECORD CALLED EXTRA IN THIS BOX SET I PLAYED IT FOR CHRIS RAZZ THE OTHER DAY AND HE WAS LIKE HOW IN THE HELL IS HE MAKING THOSE SOUNDS IS THERE ANY OVERDUB IN THIS NO  ONE OF THE NARRATIVES ABOUT CHOMP FROM WHAT IVE READ IN THE HISTORY OF PYLON FOR THIS BOOK THATS IN THIS BOX SET IS THAT IT SAYS THAT WE BECAME MUSICIANS THAT WERE WILLING TO REARRANGE EVERYTHING IN THE STUDIO I DONT KNOW IF I REALLY BUY THAT AS THE FULL ANSWER FOR WHY CHOMP SOUNDS DIFFERENT I THINK IT WAS JUST THAT WE WERE ON THE ROAD A LOT I JUST THINK CHOMP WAS THE RESULT OF A MATURATION FROM LOTS AND LOTS OF GIGS AND JUST DIFFERENT TYPES OF SONGWRITING DYNAMICS  HAY MAYBE JAMMING IS NOT QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT CREATING SOUNDS ON THE SPOT YOU WOULD FIND A RIFF THAT WORKS AND JUST KEEP GOING WITH IT IN THE CASE OF K THE VERY FIRST TIME WE PERFORMED IT IT FELL COMPLETELY APART IT WAS NOTHING LIKE WE HAD PLANNED ON DOING LIVE AND WE WERE ULTRAEMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT ONE OF THE SEAWRIGHT GUYS CAME UP AND THEY WERE JUST RAVING ABOUT THAT NEW SONG EDS NOTE VISUAL ARTIST SAM SEAWRIGHT AND WRITER JOHN SEAWRIGHT BROTHERS IN THE ATHENS ARTS SCENE AND SO WE GOT TO THE TAPE TO LISTEN TO IT AND WENT WHOA THE SONG THAT FELL COMPLETELY APART DOESNT SUCK ITS REALLY GOOD AND SO IT TOOK US MAYBE A MONTH TO RECREATE THAT ACCIDENT TO WHERE WE COULD PLAY IT AGAIN HAY WE WERE STRONG ENOUGH IN OUR OWN PERSONAL BELIEF THAT WHEN WE HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT  THAT WAS A REALLY HAPPY ACCIDENT  WE RECOGNIZED THAT AS SOMETHING WORTH PURSUING  PYLON BOX FEATURES SEVERAL PHOTOS OF PYLON EPHEMERA INCLUDING THE BANDS EQUIPMENT AND THE STYLISH DRESS THAT VANESSA BRISCOE HAY WORE ON THE BACK COVER OF GYRATE NOW HOUSED AT THE SPECIAL COLLECTIONS LIBRARY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA IN ATHENS

LEARNED A LOT FROM COOL TOWN BUT MAYBE EVEN MORE FROM AUTHOR GRACE ELIZABETH HALES PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ON THAT TIME IN ATHENS ONE BIT THAT STUCK OUT TO ME WAS HER DESCRIPTION OF VANESSAS STAGE PRESENCE THAT YOU RARELY FLIRTED WITH THE AUDIENCE THIS WAS THE ERA OF DEBBIE HARRY BUT ALSO THE BS AND SIOUXSIE SIOUX WHEN DIFFERENT SORTS OF SEXUALITY WERE BEING PRESENTED AND CHALLENGED ON STAGE WERE YOU CONSCIOUS OF HOW YOU PERFORMED HAY THATS A GOOD QUESTION CURTIS TOLD ME I WAS TERMINALLY SHY WHEN I CAME INTO THE FIRST REHEARSAL HE SAID I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE BUT I GOT ON JUST GREAT WITH ALL OF THESE GUYS AND I WAS ABLE TO TALK VERY OPENLY WITH THEM I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PAINTERS AND ARTISTS WHETHER THEY BE MEN OR WOMEN DONT NECESSARILY FEEL LIKE THEIR ARTISTIC SPIRIT IS NECESSARILY MALE OR FEMALE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A PURE SPIRIT AS SOMETHING YOU CAN KEEP COMING BACK TO AS A PART OF YOU THAT ALWAYS EXISTS I DONT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT SO I WASNT TRYING TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN MYSELF AND THATS JUST HOW IT WAS AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE WITH A GROUP OF OTHER ARTISTS WHO TREATED ME AS AN EQUAL THEY WERE SORT OF LIKE MY BROTHERS ON THE ROAD WE GOT ALONG REALLY WELL IT WAS A LOT OF FUN SO THATS ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT I WAS JUST BEING MYSELF CROWE VANESSA WHATEVER SHYNESS YOU MAY HAVE HAD YOU GOT OVER IT LAUGHS HAY THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED IN ATLANTA THERE WAS A GUY WHO FLEW IN TO SEE US AND HE SAID IM SO GLAD TO SEE THAT YOURE FINALLY COMFORTABLE IN YOUR OWN SKIN AND I JUST STARTED LAUGHING AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT IT ONLY TOOK ME  YEARS AND THEN HE STARTED AGAIN YOURE THE SOUTHERN PATTI SMITH AND I WAS JUST LIKE OH MY GOD DONT EVEN MENTION MY NAME IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS THAT WOMAN OH MY GOSH GOSH ITS LIKE I CANT TALK TO YOU ANYMORE FROM WHAT IVE READ IN OLD INTERVIEWS A STRONG BOND BETWEEN NEW YORK AND ATHENS FORMED IN THE EARLY S THERE WAS A REAL ENERGY BETWEEN THOSE SCENES KICKSTARTED BY THE BS AND CONTINUED BY REM ONE OF YOUR MAJOR GOALS FOR PYLON WAS TO PLAY NEW YORK AND GET A NICE REVIEW WHY DID YALL DECIDE TO STAY IN ATHENS HAY PYLON VISITED MANY CITIES AND WE LOVED MANY OF THEM BUT NEW YORK WAS SPECIAL TO US AND THEIR ART AND MUSIC SCENE EMBRACED US WE ALSO LOVED ATHENS AND THE COMMUNITY WE WERE A PART OF HERE AT THAT TIME ATHENS WAS MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE I THINK IT OCCURRED TO US THAT WE COULD MAINTAIN A CONNECTION WITH NEW YORK AND OTHER CITIES WE LIKED BY PERFORMINGTOURING TAKING AN EXTRA DAY OR TWO OFF TO DO SOMETHING WHILE ON TOUR THEN GO BACK HOME AND BE ABLE TO PAY OUR RENT FROM WHAT WE HAD EARNED WHILE ON TOUR WE WERE ALL NATURALLY FRUGAL AND IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD A SCENE WAS REINFORCED AND EXPANDED BY PEOPLE LIKE MY BANDMATES CURTIS WHO COFOUNDED THE  WATT CLUB AND MICHAEL WHO WORKED AT WAX JR FACTS AND CREATED ART EVENTS AND SHOWS AND BY ALL THE BANDS WHO FORMED AND ALSO REMAINED HERE WHEN THE BS HAD LEFT SOMEONE HAD TO STEP UP IN ATHENSMICHAEL LACHOWSKICROWE I SAW NEW YORK AS KIND OF THE ARTISTS MOUNT EVEREST IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE EXPECTED TO MIGRATE THERE AFTER GRADUATION AS A TRIAL BY FIRE PERIOD BESIDES BEING INTIMIDATED BY THE WHOLE PROSPECT I REALLY LIKED TREES CICADAS HOT SUMMER NIGHTS AND SKINNY DIPPING I WASNT REALLY READY TO GIVE ALL THAT UP TO PROVE MY METTLE STILL THERE WERE THE BEGINNINGS OF AN EXPAT ARTISTS COMMUNITY THAT FORMED A KIND OF LOYAL BAND OF REFUGEES THE WORLDWIDE ART AND MUSIC SCENES HAD ALREADY EXCHANGED THEIR DNA AND SO WHEN THE BS BROKE OUT IN NEW YORK IT WAS A NATURAL OCCURRENCE FOR THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN EXPAT TRIBE TO SHOW UP IN THE BEGINNING I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR SUCCESS THERE WAS THE EXCITEMENT BUILT BY WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY RECEIVING A POSTCARD FROM HOME IT WAS THIS ATMOSPHERE THAT GAVE US THE LOVING BUBBLE TO EXPLORE OUR OWN LIMITATIONS AND STYLE LACHOWSKI I CANT SAY FOR SURE THAT THIS ENTERED INTO WHY PYLON NEVER CONSIDERED RELOCATING TO NEW YORK OR ANYWHERE ELSE BUT ONE OF RANDYS ARGUMENTS TO ME ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD START A BAND WAS THAT WHEN THE BS HAD LEFT SOMEONE HAD TO STEP UP IN ATHENS SO IN A WAY IT WAS OUR ROLE TO BE AN ATHENS BAND ACCORDING TO THAT ASPECT OF OUR ORIGIN BEING IN NEW YORK FELT REALLY EASY AS PYLON THE BS HAD TURNED US ONTO THE IROQUOIS HOTEL AND HELPED US GET THOSE FIRST GIGS AND ALL THE NECESSARY PHONE NUMBERS EXATHENIANS STEVE AND BRONWYN HINTON HOSTED HOUSE PARTIES WITH OTHER ATHENIANS WHEN WE WERE IN TOWN THE CRITICS WERE RECEPTIVE BUT I DONT THINK ANY OF US SAW OURSELVES LIVING THERE AND BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE THERE AT ALL AND PYLONS AMBITIONS WERE LIMITED IN SCOPE AND A VAGUELY SENSED TIME FRAME NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY SUCH A DISRUPTION EVEN IF WE HAD WANTED TO MOVE THERE DID YALL EVER EXPECT TO MAKE SUCH A LASTING IMPRESSION HAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LEGACY CHANGED OVER TIME AS YOUVE MET NEW FANS CROWE AFTER THE BAND BROKE UP I ENDED UP GETTING IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY  AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE CONNECTIONS IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY THE MOVIE IM DOING RIGHT NOW IS A FOX FEATURE AND ON THE FIRST DAY ON THE JOB THE DIRECTOR COMES UP TO ME AND HE GOES HEY I THINK MY BAND OPENED FOR YOU GUYS IN TRENTON NEW JERSEY NOW WERE SENDING PICTURES BACK AND FORTH OF FLYERS AND BAND POSTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO ITS JUST A TRIP TO JUST KEEP GOING AND GOING LIKE IT DOES  LACHOWSKI WHEN IT COMES TO WHO IS INFLUENCING WHO AND THE LEGACY AND ALL OF THAT TO ME IT JUST KEEPS FOLDING ONTO ITSELF I MEAN WE WERE PRETTY COCKY WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR FIRST TWO ALBUMS AND BROKE UP MAYBE THAT ENERGY MADE MUSIC THAT LASTS FOR PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN WAY BUT I DONT REALLY KNOW HOW TO MEASURE IT AND PUT IT ALL INTO A NARRATIVE HAY WE WERE JUST BEING OURSELVES AND WE WERENT REALLY BEHOLDEN TO ANYBODY WHO WAS TRYING TO MOLD US OR SHAPE US INTO ANYTHING DB RECORDS OWNER DANNY BEARD DIDNT DO THAT HE JUST LET US BE OURSELVES AND SO I THINK SOME OF THAT SHINES THROUGH THERES A LOT OF AUTHENTICITY IN THAT WE WERE BEING OURSELVESPYLONFACEBOOKTWITTERFLIPBOARDEMAILEDITORS PICKSREAD  LISTENHOMENEWSCULTUREMUSICPODCASTS  SHOWSCONNECTNEWSLETTERSFACEBOOKTWITTERINSTAGRAMPRESSCONTACT

CONTENT YOUTUBE IS WHERE MOST VIEWERS WILL SEE IT WHERE ENTIRE CAREERS CAN BE LAUNCHED OFF THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF SIGHT AND SOUND LONG BEFORE SHE WAS MAKING HER OWN VIDEOS TAMPA RAPPER DOECHII PICKED UP ON AN UNSPOKEN RULE ABOUT POPULAR MEDIAS RELATIONSHIP WITH NUDITY NO MATTER THE CONTEXT NO MATTER THE ARTISTIC INTENT A BLACK WOMANS BODY WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE SEEN AS INHERENTLY SEXUAL A YEAR AGO SHE TRIED TO CONFRONT THAT RULE HEAD ON  AND LEARNED THAT EVEN NOW YEARS INTO OUR ERA OF DIGITAL DEMOCRACY NO PLATFORM IS WITHOUT A POINT OF VIEW DOECHII ISNT JUST ONE OF THE LATEST SIGNEES TO POWERHOUSE RAP LABEL TDE  SHES ALSO THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE ROSTER WHO RAPS SHE HAD TO BE NICE TO EARN THAT SPOT AND SHE KNOWS IT FROM THE MINUTE SHE SIGNED SHE WAS THROWING AROUND BIG IDEAS FOR HER

ALWAYS CALLED ME CRAZY WHEN THEY DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IM DOING OR THEY WANT ME TO FEEL BAD ABOUT THE BOLDNESS OR THE AMBITION OR THE AUDACITY DOECHII SAYS IVE KIND OF MORPHED MYSELF INTO REALIZING THE POWER OF BEING THE BLACK BITCH REALIZING THE POWER OF BEING PAINTED AS THE VILLAIN  NOWPLAYING DOECHII CRAZYSHE CHANNELED THAT ENERGY INTO HER DEBUT SINGLE CRAZY  A CHAOTIC YET CONFIDENT TRACK THAT CALLS OUT THE DOUBT AND DOUBLE STANDARDS SHES ALWAYS FACED AS AN ARTIST RECLAIMING THE WORD BY SCREAMING IT BACK WHEN IT CAME TIME TO MAKE VISUALS FOR THE SONG SHE WANTED TO PUSH THAT NOTION EVEN FURTHER HER INSPIRATION WAS A CARD FROM THE TAROT DECK THE STAR THERES A WOMAN WHOS NAKED BENDING IN THE WATER AND THIS IS HER FULLEST POTENTIAL SHE EXPLAINS OF THE IMAGE I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO THE WORLD AND DEBUT MY FIRST SINGLE NAKED  AS A SYMBOL OF VULNERABILITY BUT ALSO ULTIMATE POWER DOECHIIS VISION FOR THE CRAZY VIDEO CALLED FOR NUDITY AS A MAIN INGREDIENT BUT NOT IN A WAY MEANT TO BE AT ALL SEXUAL OR PLEASURABLE INSTEAD SHE HOPED TO USE HER NAKED BODY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MALE GAZE CHALLENGING PERVASIVE IDEAS ABOUT NAKEDNESS IN GENERAL AND BLACK WOMENS BODIES IN HIPHOP SPECIFICALLY  HIRING A DIRECTOR WASNT EASY DOECHII SAYS MOST PEOPLE SHE APPROACHED ABOUT THE PROJECT WERE AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON OR EVEN TRIED TO TALK HER OUT OF IT NOT THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED IN THE STREAMING ERA FOR A VIDEO TO MAKE MONETARY SENSE IT HAS TO DO WELL ON YOUTUBE A PLATFORM WITH A SPOTTY RECORD FOR POLICING BLACK BODIES NEVER FORGET THAT THE COMPANY WAS LITERALLY STARTED SO PEOPLE COULD GET A SECOND LOOK AT JANET JACKSONS NIPPLE BACK IN  PULLING OFF THE PLAN FOR CRAZY WOULD MEAN CONFRONTING SOME DEEPLY ENTRENCHED MISOGYNOIR LUCKILY DOECHII FOUND SOMEONE WILLING TO GO TO WAR WITH HER FEMMES ARE SORT OF UNDER UNDENIABLE INESCAPABLE GAZE AT THE BODY SAYS SARAH PRINZ A LOS ANGELES DIRECTOR AND CHOREOGRAPHER BETTER KNOWN AS C PRINZ WHO HAS WORKED WITH ARTISTS INCLUDING BILLIE EILISH THE WEEKND AND CHLOE BAILEY WE HAVE TO CARRY ON DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO WITH THAT GAZE ON US AND IT WAS SORT OF MY MISSION TO CHARGE THE BODIES AND CHARGE THE STORY IN A WAY THAT YOU ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THE NUDITY  LOUDER THAN A RIOT SEASON  MC SHAROCK CLAIMS HER PLACE IN HIPHOP HISTORYPRINZ CAME UP WITH A VIDEO TREATMENT DOECHII LOVED WHICH WOULD PUT HER IN A DYSTOPIAN SETTING AT THE HEAD OF A SQUAD OF DANCERS ALL OF THEM NUDE TINY COVERINGS AND VISUAL EFFECTS WOULD OBSCURE THE NIPPLES AND GENITALS BUT JUST BARELY THE ARTIST HAD ONLY ONE NOTE FOR THE DIRECTOR PRINZ HAD PITCHED FILLING THE FRAME WITH EVERY SKIN COLOR SHE COULD FIND BUT DOECHII SAID SHE WANTED AN ALLBLACK CAST EVERYBODY SHOULD BE INCLUDED BUT THERE ARE JUST SOME STORIES THAT ARE FOR A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE DOECHII SAYS FOR THIS VIDEO I WANTED TO CURATE A SPACE SPECIFICALLY FOR BLACK WOMEN  OF ALL DIFFERENT COLORS BUT BLACK WOMEN SPECIFICALLY THATS WHAT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON I WANTED IT TO BE FOR US BY US DANCED BY US CREATED BY US THEIR VISION WAS COMING TOGETHER THEN A WEEK BEFORE THEY WERE SET TO START SHOOTING PRINZ WAS ASKED TO JOIN AN EMERGENCY ZOOM CALL EVERYBODYS ON THE LINE  LIKE   PEOPLE THERE SHE RECALLS AND IM LIKE WHATS THIS ABOUT PRINZ SAYS MOOSA TIFFITH THE PRESIDENT OF TDE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT WORD HAD GOTTEN AROUND ABOUT WHAT WAS PLANNED FOR THE CRAZY VIDEO AND THAT THERE WERE SOME RESERVATIONS FROM THE LABEL AND MANAGEMENT TIFFITH WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING DOECHII TO TDE IN THE FIRST PLACE ADDS THAT HIS CONCERN WAS FOR THE ARTISTS SAKE AS WELL I WANT TO PROTECT HER I DONT WANT TO SEE HER DISRESPECTED IN NO TYPE OF WAY HE SAYS FOR SOME REASON WE WASNT AWARE SHE WAS GONNA BE NAKED THE ENTIRE SHOOT I DONT THINK IT WAS A CONCERN OF HOW ITS GONNA COME OFF  IT WAS JUST A MOMENT WHERE WE WERE LIKE HEY HOW DID WE LET THIS SLIP UNDER THE RUG ITS EASY TO WRITE OFF TIFFITHS APPREHENSION TO DOECHIIS IDEA AS FEAR  AND YET FEAR IS THE EXACT IMPULSE THAT STRUCTURAL PATRIARCHY PREYS UPON NUDGING INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE IN LINE WITH THE SYSTEM FIGHTING THAT INSTINCT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PROJECT SO C PRINZ DOUBLED DOWN THE VIDEO WOULD GO FORWARD NO COMPROMISES

BLUNTLY AS IT COULD WITH DOECHII SHOOTING SOMEONE IN THE HEAD WITH A HANDGUN FROM THERE EVERYTHING RAMPS UP SHE AND THE DANCERS SMASH CARS SET FIRES SPRAY SHOTS FROM MACHINE GUNS PUT CIGARETTES OUT ON THEIR SKIN IN THE FINAL SECONDS THE VIEWER LEARNS THAT THE WOMAN DOECHII SHOT AT THE START OF THE FILM WAS ACTUALLY DOECHII HERSELF USUALLY IF SOMEBODYS SHOOTING OR THERES GUNS OR WAR PEOPLE HAVE ON ARMOR AND I WANTED TO SYMBOLIZE HOW ME COMING INTO THE INDUSTRY AS VULNERABLE AS I AM IM COMING TO YALL WITH NO ARMOR YOU COULD SHOOT ME AND YOU COULD KILL ME RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD BE DONE FOR DOECHII SAYS ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN IN HIPHOP HURTING ME IS HURTING YOU YOU KILL ONE YOU KINDA KILLING YOURSELF EVEN AMID ALL THE ANARCHY THERES A COMMUNAL ENERGY THAT IS PALPABLE ONSCREEN AN ARMY OF BLACK WOMEN WAGE WAR IN AN EMPTY PARKING LOT JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE IT ALL WHILE COMPLETELY NAKED OFFCAMERA THAT SOLIDARITY MANIFESTED IN A COMMITMENT TO SAFETY ON SET AN INTIMACY COORDINATOR WAS HIRED TO SUPERVISE THE SHOOT AND REHEARSALS AND IF THE TALENT EVER FELT UNCOMFORTABLE THEY COULD GIVE A SILENT SIGNAL  ARMS CROSSED OVER THE CHEST LIKE THE WAKANDA SALUTE  AND SOMEONE WOULD INTERVENE KRYSS HICKS ONE OF THE DANCERS SAYS SHE REALIZED THE POWER OF THAT RESOURCE DURING A DRESS REHEARSAL WHICH TURNED OUT TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA EYES IN THE ROOM THERE WERE PEOPLE FROM TDE I BELIEVE WHO WAS THERE JUST WATCHING US REHEARSE AND THEY PULLED US TO THE SIDE AND THEY WERE LIKE THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM THE LABEL THEY DONT HAVE TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE  I SPOKE UP AND I WAS LIKE YEAH I DONT  I GOTTA WARM UP TO THAT AND THEY ASKED THEM TO LEAVE HICKS EXPLAINS OUT OF ALL MUSIC VIDEOS THAT IVE DONE  AND MIND YOU I REALLY JUST DISLIKE DOING MUSIC VIDEOS  BUT

AT YOUTUBE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN MOOSA TIFFITH SAYS HE HAD A LABEL REP SEND THE VIDEO TO YOUTUBE AHEAD OF TIME AND THE NEWS BACK WAS DISAPPOINTING THEY TOLD US THEY COULDNT ALLOW IT TO TREND BECAUSE THE WOMEN WERE NAKED IN THE VIDEO TIFFITH SAYS BUT I MEAN TECHNICALLY THEYRE COVERED UP YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IVE SEEN WORSE ON YOUTUBE WE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM GOING BACK AND FORTH FOR PROBABLY ABOUT A GOOD TWO WEEKS BUT THEY WERE JUST FIRM ON WHAT THEY WERE SAYING  LIKE HEY UNLESS ITS A WAY YOU GUYS CAN VFX SOME CLOTHES ONTO THESE LADIES THEN WE CANT ALLOW IT YOUTUBE WOULDNT BUDGE IN THE END THE VIDEO WAS AGERESTRICTED THAT MEANT IT WASNT ELIGIBLE TO TREND DEALING A MAJOR HIT TO ITS SEARCHABILITY AND VISIBILITY WE REACHED OUT TO A REPRESENTATIVE FROM YOUTUBE WHO DENIED OUR INTERVIEW REQUESTS FOR THIS STORY BUT WHEN WE ASKED WHAT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS VIDEO BROKE THEIR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES THEY POINTED US TO THE PLATFORMS NUDITY AND SEXUAL CONTENT POLICY WHICH READS IN PART EXPLICIT CONTENT MEANT TO BE SEXUALLY GRATIFYING IS NOT ALLOWED ON YOUTUBE THE IRONY IN THAT LANGUAGE IS ALMOST TOO CLEAR DOECHIIS ENTIRE THESIS IN MAKING THE VIDEO HAD BEEN TO COMBAT THE MALE GAZE TO PRESENT EXPOSED FEMME BODIES AS ANYTHING BUT SEXUALLY GRATIFYING TO OPERATE WITHIN THE STATED RULES OF THE GAME THE DECISIONMAKERS IN CHARGE SAW IT AS THE EXACT THING IT WAS MADE TO DEFY AND DEEMED IT GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS THE VIDEO LINKED BELOW CONTAINS NONSEXUAL OBSCURED NUDITY IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY YOUTUBE FROM EMBEDDING OUTSIDE THE PLATFORM CLICK WATCH ON YOUTUBE TO SEE IT IN FULLYOUTUBE THE CRAZY VIDEO DROPPED ON YOUTUBE ON APRIL   DOECHII REMEMBERS THAT IN THAT MOMENT SHE WANTED TO FEEL HEROIC BUT IN TRUTH SHE FELT SCARED SHED BRIEFED HER MOTHER ON THE CONCEPT BUT DIDNT KNOW HOW THE REST OF HER FAMILY LET ALONE A GLOBAL AUDIENCE WOULD REACT EVEN THOUGH ITS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR ME I WAS JUST SCARED THAT I WOULD HURT PEOPLES FEELINGS OR I WOULD OFFEND BLACK WOMEN AND THEY WOULDNT GET IT SHE SAYS BUT IT TURNED OUT BEING THE OPPOSITE  THEY REALLY REALLY FED WITH IT A LOT OF BLACK GIRLS SAID THAT THEY JUST LOVED TO SEE A DARK SKIN BLACK GIRL IN A NONSEXUALIZED WAY AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS DOPE BUT THAT WAS EVEN IF THEY GOT TO SEE IT FOR ALL THE TIME MONEY AND INTENTION PUT INTO THE VIDEO CRAZY NEVER HIT YOUTUBES HOMEPAGE IT ONLY RECENTLY CROSSED  MILLION VIEWS  MONTHS AFTER ITS RELEASE  A MILESTONE FOR ANY ARTIST BUT SMALL TIME COMPARED TO UPANDCOMERS ON THE PLATFORM WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF INDUSTRY INTEREST BEHIND THEM NEVERTHELESS DOECHII HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR CONTINUING TO PUT HER ARTISTRY ON DISPLAY SHE SHOWED THE POWER OF HER BODY IN MOVEMENT IN THE VIDEO FOR WHAT IT IS BLOCK BOY AND PERHAPS JUST AS PROVOCATIVELY COVERED ALL BUT HER FACE IN HER PERFORMANCE OF STRESSED FOR THE ONLINE SERIES COLORS CRAZY MAY NOT HAVE STARTED THE LARGER DIALOGUE SHED HOPED FOR BUT SHES NEVER REGRETTED THE RISK SHE TOOK IT DOESNT AFFECT MY CREATIVITY IM STILL GONNA KEEP PUSHING THESE MESSAGES IM STILL GOING TO KEEP CHALLENGING THESE SYSTEMS AND THESE IDEALS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BUT I MEAN IT DOES AFFECT ME BECAUSE LOOK WHAT HAPPENED  LESS PEOPLE CAN SEE IT BECAUSE OF THESE RULES AND THINGS THAT ARE IN PLACE SO ITS NOT GONNA AFFECT MY CREATIVITY BUT IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE MY ART SHE SAYS THIS HYPOCRISY DOECHII IS TALKING ABOUT ISNT THAT HARD TO SEE  IF YOURE ABLE TO LOOK PAST THE VEIL OF THE MALE GAZE FOR HER PART WITNESSING THE CENSORED RELEASE OF CRAZY IS A PERFECT ARGUMENT FOR WHY ART LIKE IT NEEDS TO EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS GOES BACK TO THE POINT OF WHY IM MAKING THE TYPE OF MUSIC I MAKE AND WHY I PUT OUT THESE TYPE OF VISUALS SHE SAYS I WANT IT TO BE TO A POINT WHERE

MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT A SONG FORM CAN EMERGE OUT OF GROUP IMPROV AND RITUAL TIME AS AN EXPRESSION OF TEMPO UNGOVERNED BY GENRE OR MARKET CONCERNS AFTAB WHOSE  ALBUM VULTURE PRINCE WAS A CRITICAL AND CULTURAL BREAKTHROUGH ALSO POINTEDLY PUSHED BACK AGAINST ANY PRIVILEGING OF VOICE OR LYRICS WITHIN THE MUSIC IM SAYING LOTS OF RANDOM FRAGMENTS OF THINGS BECAUSE IM TRYING TO USE THEM AS VOWELS TO REALLY JUST SING SHE SAID I NEVER GET TO DO THAT SO THIS PROJECT IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING FOR ME BECAUSE I GET TO FLEX A LITTLE BIT IM NOT A VERY SHOWCASEY SINGER IN MY OTHER PROJECTS BUT IN THIS ONE I GET TO GO TO SPACES VERY FREELY WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MUSIC IS SHARED LOVE IN EXILE IS A CHRONICLE OF THAT SHARED EXPERIENCE SUFFUSED WITH UNFOLDING MYSTERY AND

CHARGED EVEN BEFORE WE HAD PLAYED LIKE THERE WAS ALREADY LIKE A FEELING OF NEEDING TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE AUDIENCE ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT TO BEFLORIDO AROOJ AFTAB IS A GRAMMYWINNING SINGER AND COMPOSER THAT NIGHT SHE WAS JOINED BY COMPOSERS VIJAY IYER AND SHAHZAD ISMAILY AFTAB DIDNT KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD SAY TO THE AUDIENCE THE TRIO HAD NEVER EVEN REHEARSED BUT AFTAB WHO IS PAKISTANI FOUND HERSELF TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE INTENTION BEHIND THE MUSIC  TO REFLECT ON LEAVING ONES HOME AND FINDING MEANING AND BELONGING ALONG THE WAY SHE USED THE PHRASE LOVE IN EXILEAFTAB AND LUCKILY VIJAY REMEMBERED THATVIJAY IYER LAUGHTERAFTAB SO ITS A GREAT TITLE FOR THE RECORD CAUSE I CERTAINLY DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT I HAD SAIDIYER LAUGHTERAFTAB IN THAT MOMENTFLORIDO THE THREE OF THEM STARTED CALLING THEIR GROUP LOVE IN EXILE AND NOW THATS ALSO THE TITLE OF THEIR NEW ALBUMSOUNDBITE OF SONG LAST NIGHTAFTAB SINGING IN NONENGLISH LANGUAGEFLORIDO NATE CHINEN FROM WRTI IN PHILADELPHIA SAT DOWN WITH THE BAND TO HEAR HOW THEIR SOUND GREW OUT OF THAT ONE NIGHT IN  HERES COMPOSER VIJAY IYERIYER I THINK THE BEST BANDS BEGIN WITH A FEELING YOU KNOW ITS SORT OF THIS FEELING LIKE THIS HAS TO KEEP HAPPENING AND THATS BASICALLY HOW WE FELT AFTER THAT I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE COMING OFFSTAGE SHAHZAD JUST HELD US TOGETHER AND LIKE LITERALLY PUT HIS ARMS AROUND USSOUNDBITE OF SONG LAST NIGHTAFTAB SINGING IN NONENGLISH LANGUAGENATE CHINEN BYLINE AND HOW DOES THE PLAY OF WIDEOPEN IMPROVISATIONAL TEXTURE AND LIKE TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS AND YOU KNOW FOLK ELEMENTS  LIKE WHAT IS THE PLAY OF THAT IN THIS GROUP BECAUSE IT STRIKES ME AS REALLY ORGANIC BUT ALSO LIKE VERY CONSIDEREDAFTAB YEAH YOU WOULD THINK THAT ITS ALL AMBIENT AND THERES A LOT OF SPACE AND WERE JUST SORT OF LIKE NEWAGING IT YOU KNOWIYER LAUGHTERAFTAB ITS VERY  IF YOU LISTEN ITS VERY TIGHT ITS SUPER KNIT TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT COMES FROM JUST LIKE OUR EXPERIENCE AS COMPOSERS OVER SO MANY DECADES AND JUST EARS ARE REALLY OPEN AND THAT CAPABILITY TO JUST LIKE LEAD AND FOLLOW EACH OTHER AND  YOU KNOW AND KEEPING IT SO CONTEXTUAL INSTEAD OF JUST  ITS NOT A FREE JAM ITS SUCCINCT IDEAS THAT KIND OF LEAD INTO ANOTHER IDEA AND THEN AT SOME POINT WERE LIKE OK WERE KIND OF DONE AND NOW WERE JUST NOODLING AND SO WE KIND OF  ITS LIKE WE WRAP IT UP TOIYER LAUGHTERAFTAB YOU KNOW KNOW ITS SOLIDSHAHZAD ISMAILY AND ID SAY WHEN YOURE TALKING ABOUT THE VARIED IMPULSES OR THE VARIED TEXTURAL SPACES OF A LANGUAGE WORDS FROM A CULTURAL SPACE OR MUSICAL CHOICES WHAT I IMAGINE TO BE BEHIND THAT IS THE INITIAL HUMAN IMPULSE TO MAKE SOUND LIKE IF  I OFTEN IN A ROMANTICIZED WAY THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE  YEARS AGO WHEN SOUND  WHEN WE WERE MAKING SOUND TOGETHER IF WE PULL BACK AND THE THREE OF US TAP INTO THAT IMPULSE THEN WERE ON THE SAME TRACK REGARDLESS OF WHAT CLOTHING WERE WEARING MUSICALLY IN THE MOMENTSOUNDBITE OF SONG LAST NIGHTAFTAB SINGING IN NONENGLISH LANGUAGECHINEN LETS TALK ABOUT THE LYRICS ON THE ALBUM ID LOVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PIECE IN WHICH WHAT YOURE SINGING COMES OUT OF WHATS HAPPENING MUSICALLY ORAFTAB SO LIKE I WANTED TO BE AN INSTRUMENT TOO WHICH IS LIKE A REALLY CHEESY THING THAT VOCALISTS SAY FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT JUST DOESNT REALLY GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE YOU JUST CANT BE AN INSTRUMENT YOURE THE VOCALIST YOU KNOW IT JUST DOESNT WORK THAT WAY BUT WHEN YOURE SCATTING YOU KNOW YOU CAN SCRATCH THAT SURFACE A LITTLE BIT IM SAYING LOTS OF RANDOM FRAGMENTS OF THINGS BECAUSE IM TRYING TO JUST USE THEM AS VOWELS TO REALLY JUST SING SO I KIND OF ON THIS PROJECT CRINGE WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHAT ARE THE  WHATS THE TRANSLATION OF THE LYRICSIYER LAUGHTERCHINEN RIGHTAFTAB IM JUST LIKE NO  BECAUSE THEN ITS GOING TO BE ABOUT THAT YOU KNOWCHINEN YEAH YEAHAFTAB BUT I WILL SAY THAT OF COURSE IM NOT A MONSTER SO LIKE WHATEVER IM  WHATEVER WERE PLAYING LIKE IM FEELING IT AND I AM SAYING STUFF THAT IS  ITS NOT DISCONNECTED SO FOR EXAMPLE SHADOW FORCES IM ACTUALLY SINGING A RESHMA TUNE YOU KNOW WHICH IS IN PUNJABI AGAIN ITS LIKE FRAGMENTS YOU KNOW SO IT FELT KIND OF SHADOWY AND KIND OF DARK AND THEN THERES ALWAYS LIKE THE DARK JUXTAPOSED WITH THE BRIGHT MOMENT IN MANY OF THE PIECES ITS NOT EVER JUST ONE

DRINKING WINECHINEN THROWING ROSES AROUNDLAUGHTERCHINEN ILL FLOAT ONE MORE QUESTION WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE LIFE OF THIS GROUP AFTER THIS MUSIC IS OUT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU USING THIS MATERIAL AS KIND OF THE SPRINGBOARD AT THIS POINT OR IS IT A DOCUMENT AND YOUVE KIND OF MOVED ON TO EXPLORING OTHER AREASISMAILY I HOPE TO SEE US CONTINUE TO PERFORM ALL OF THE UPCOMING CONCERTS WITH NOTHING PREPARED WHATSOEVER AND NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE RECORDED MATERIAL BECAUSE WHAT HAS BEEN INSPIRING THUS FAR FOR ME HAS BEEN WALKING OUT AND LISTENING AND GIVING I DONT KNOW WHAT WILL COME BECAUSE I IMAGINE  CHECK IN WITH OURSELVES AS THE YEAR UNFOLDS AND SEE  WILL WE ALL WALK AWAY FROM EACH OTHER TOWARDS EACH OTHER TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE AND WELL SEEIYER I THINK ITS THE SORT OF THING THAT CAN BE MADE

RAINBOWLIT ROOM IN NASHVILLE WHERE LAUGHTER AND THE SCINTILLATING LIGHT OF MUTUAL ADORATION CREATED A SANCTUARY MOMENTARILY IN A STATE FULL OF HUNTERS AND THEN I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER SMALLER ROOM WITH WALLS MADE OF GLITTER THAT KEPT OUT THE COLD OF A RAINY NIGHT I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT TWO SHOWS I SAW THIS WEEK ONE IN AN ARENA AND THE OTHER IN A DINNER THEATER THAT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING IVE LONG BELIEVED BUT RECENTLY DOUBTED THAT MUSIC CAN SUSTAIN PEOPLE AND IF NOT CHANGE THINGS ITSELF MAKE CHANGE CONCEIVABLE BUT FIRST I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME BACK TO ALABAMA WHERE I LIVED BEFORE NASHVILLE TO A MOMENT THAT CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW POLITICAL ACTIVISM WORKS  IN  DOUG JONES RAN FOR SENATE IN A SPECIAL ELECTION JONES IS A DEMOCRAT AND HIS WIN WOULD MARK THE FIRST TIME IN A QUARTER CENTURY THAT THE PARTY CAPTURED ONE OF ALABAMAS SEATS IN THE US SENATE I AM TELLING THIS STORY NOT TO ENDORSE A PARTY OR A CANDIDATE WHOS NO LONGER IN OFFICE BY THE WAY BUT TO SHOW HOW AWARENESS AND EMPOWERMENT SPREADS AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL THE POLLS AND THE PUNDITS OFTEN TREAT THE CULTURAL SHIFTS THAT SHAPE POLITICS AS LINEAR AND QUANTIFIABLE BUT SOMETIMES THEY BLOOM LIKE CLOVER ACROSS A MEADOW AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFLORESCENCE RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION I FOUND MYSELF ON BOOK TOUR IN MY OLD HOMETOWN OF TUSCALOOSA MY READING WAS SPARSELY ATTENDED MANY OF THE FOLKS I KNEW AS A FORMER UNIVERSITY SPOUSE WERE OUT RINGING DOORBELLS AND WORKING THE PHONES I DID RUN INTO ONE OF THEM THOUGH A WOMAN DEVOTED TO CIVIC LIFE WHOD HERSELF SERVED AND STRUGGLED IN ALABAMA POLITICS I ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD COME OF JONES CAMPAIGN  MY FRIEND IS A VERY CLEAREYED PERSON SHE SAID SHE RECOGNIZED THAT A VICTORY WAS LESS THAN A SURE THING AND THAT IF IT CAME SUCCESS COULD BE BRIEF BUT SHE SAID SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAD COME OUT OF THE RACE PEOPLE WHO FOR YEARS HAD BEEN FIGHTING THEIR OWN BLUE BATTLES IN A FAMOUSLY RED STATE HAD MET THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL BECAME TANGIBLE TO EACH OTHER MY FRIEND AND OTHERS IN MY COLLEGE TOWN  MOSTLY WHITE WOMEN INVOLVED WITH THE UNIVERSITY  ENCOUNTERED ORGANIZERS MANY OF THEM AFRICANAMERICAN WOMEN IN THE SOCALLED BLACK BELT OF THE STATE AND AS THEY BECAME AWARE OF EACH OTHER EVERYONE REDEFINED THEIR OWN APPROACHES SCATTERED EFFORTS BECAME A MOVEMENT BEFORE WE WERE UNABLE TO SEE IT MY FRIEND SAID WE BECAME VISIBLE TO EACH OTHER AND THAT WONT CHANGE VISIBILITY  ITS A CATCHWORD ESPECIALLY AMONG MEMBERS AND ALLIES OF THE LGBTQIA COMMUNITY THAT CAN SOMETIMES FEEL A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE PAST HALFDECADE AS SOME KEY CIVIL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN CODIFIED INTO LAW THERES BEEN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN LGBTQIA REPRESENTATION WITHIN POPULAR CULTURE AT THE SAME TIME A NEW WAVE OF MORAL PANIC ESPECIALLY ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE HAS ARISEN ENDANGERING LIVES AND INSPIRING THE MANY LAWS CURRENTLY MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH STATE LEGISLATURES IN TENNESSEE THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE SEEN COUNTRY STARS FROM KACEY MUSGRAVES TO DOLLY PARTON CELEBRATING DRAG AND DIVERSITY AND YET THE STATE HAS LED THE WAY IN RESTRICTING THE RIGHTS OF THE VERY PEOPLE THESE CELEBRITIES EMBRACE THE QUESTION ARISES GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT IS THE WORTH OF THE VISIBILITY THAT MANIFESTS WHEN STORIES ARE TOLD OR SONGS ARE SUNG WHEN THREATS TO SAFETY AND FULL CITIZENSHIP ARE AN EVERYDAY REALITY WERE NOT METAPHORS THE TRANS WRITER THOMAS PAGE MCBEE WROTE IN A  ANALYSIS OF THIS PREDICAMENT  MUSIC FEATURES WHERE AM I GOING TO BE FREE TO BE WHO I AM TENNESSEE MUSICIANS GRAPPLE WITH THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF NEW ANTIDRAG LAWMUSIC IS ONE WAY VISIBILITY CAN GO BEYOND THE SYMBOLIC AND BOLSTER VITAL CONNECTIONS BUT ONLY WHEN THOSE WHO MAKE IT AND THOSE WHO LOVE IT GATHER FORGE ALLIANCES AND SUSTAIN EACH OTHER OVER TIME AS I REVELED IN THE SPIRIT OF DEFIANCE AND YES JOY THAT PERMEATED MONDAYS LOVE RISING EXTRAVAGANZA AT BRIDGESTONE ARENA AND TUESDAYS WE WILL ALWAYS BE REVUE AT CITY WINERY I FELT WHAT VISIBILITY  AND AUDIBILITY THE AMPLIFYING FORCE THAT MOVES THROUGH VOICES RHYTHMS AND MELODIES   CAN PROVIDE WHEN CRISIS IS AT THE DOOR THESE EVENTS WERE IN SOME WAYS STANDARD BENEFIT CONCERTS WITH MULTIPLE ARTISTS TOUCHING DOWN ON THE STAGE IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION THEIR QUICK TURNS PUNCTUATED BY PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND PLEAS FOR DONATIONS BUT AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE GAVE THESE SHOWS A POWER EVEN HISTORICAL CHARITY FESTS LIKE LIVE AID OR MORE RECENTLY THE CONCERTS FOR CHARLOTTESVILLE AND UKRAINE DID NOT HAVE  THOSE MEGAEVENTS WERE ANCHORED BY NOTABLES REACHING OUT TOWARD PERCEIVED VICTIMS WHO EVEN WHEN ABLE TO JOIN IN THE SHOWS REMAINED MOSTLY AT A DISTANCE LOVE RISING AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE CAME ABOUT BECAUSE LGBTQIA PEOPLE THEMSELVES WILLED THEM INTO BEING ALLISON RUSSELL THE SINGERSONGWRITER WHOSE RECENT COMMERCIAL BREAKTHROUGH HAS SHED SO MUCH LIGHT ON NASHVILLES POTENTIAL AS A HOME TO A TRULY PROGRESSIVE MUSIC SCENE WAS A MAIN DRIVER AS WERE ARTISTACTIVISTENTREPRENEURS HUNTER KELLY AND HOLLY G WHOSE WORK ON EFFORTS LIKE PROUD RADIO AND THE BLACK OPRY HAVE BEEN RESHAPING NASHVILLES SCENE FOR A WHILE NOW ALLIES BEHIND THE SCENES SUPPORTED THEIR VISION WITHOUT STEPPING INTO THE SPACE THEY NEEDED TO DEFINE  FROM THE GROUND UP THESE EVENTS BROUGHT TOGETHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOLDING SPACE FOR EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF FOREGROUNDING WELLINTENTIONED STARS SWOOPING IN TO DO A GOOD DEED INSTEAD OF STAGING TABLEAUS IN WHICH MARGINALIZED PEOPLE WERE TROTTED OUT FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION THESE EVENTS CREATED THE CHANCE FOR LGBTQIA FOLK TO STAND FRONT AND CENTER AND HAIL EACH OTHER IN POWER AND HOPE  LOVE RISING DID SUFFER FROM ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO FILL THE SEAT VENUE MAJOR NAMES WERE REQUIRED TAKE A LOOK AT THE POSTER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BIG NAMES WHO SHOWED UP READ THESE REVIEWS TO LEARN HOW THESE ALLIES MAXIMIZED THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE LGBTQIA COMMUNITY THROUGH SONG SELECTION AND FEATURED COLLABORATORS AND LISTEN TO THIS PLAYLIST TO HEAR EVERYONE THAT PERFORMED AT BOTH EVENTS ALL OF THEIR ADVOCACY WOULDNT  HAVE MATTERED THOUGH IF NOT FOR THE MANY QUEER NONBINARY AND TRANS ARTISTS WHOSE TIME AT THE MIC BROUGHT SOMETHING TRULY NEW TO THIS HOCKEY ARENA WHERE IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY OVERWHELMINGLY CISHET MEGASTARS CAN CLAIM SPACE  THE LIST WAS LONG REMINDING ME JUST HOW CRUCIAL LGBTQIA ARTISTS ARE WITHIN NASHVILLES CURRENT MUSICAL ECOSYSTEM AUTUMN NICHOLAS FANCY HAGOOD IZZY HELTAI SHEA DIAMOND CIDNY BULLENS SPARKLE CITY DISCO WRABEL THE SHOW OPENED WITH JAKE WESLEY ROGERS BOWIEGLOWING IN SILVER SEQUINS DAMNING HIS OWN ERASURE

THEIR CAREERS WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED TO STAND BEFORE SUCH A VAST CROWD CHEERING THEM ON SOME LIKE NICHOLAS SEIZED THE SPOTLIGHT WITH SUCH FORCE IT FELT LIKE AN ANOINTMENT OTHERS EMBRACED THEIR OWN VULNERABILITY ADEEM THE ARTIST  WHOM ID LAST SEEN PLAYING IN A LOCAL RECORD STORES BACKYARD TO MAYBE  PEOPLE  JOKED THAT THIS WAS THE LARGEST KARAOKE CROWD IVE EVER SUNG TO AND STRESSED THE MIX OF JUBILATION AND FEAR THEY FELT ENVELOPED BY LOVE BUT AWARE THAT THE THREATS JUST BEYOND THE ARENA DOORS REMAIN URGENT JOY OLADOKUN WHOSE NEXT ALBUM SHOULD GAIN THE MASS AUDIENCE HER WILDLY CATCHY HEARTFELT SONGS DESERVE SPOKE OF A TIME WHEN SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT COME OUT AND EXPRESSED FAITH IN THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF LIFE HELTAI WHOSE QUIET PRESENCE CREATED A KIND OF REVERSE OSMOSIS IN THAT HUGE SPACE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED WITHOUT GENDERAFFIRMING CARE BEFORE SINGING THE POIGNANT ALL OF THIS BEAUTY AS HIS VOICE SILENCED THE CROWD WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOUCHING MOMENT IN A NIGHTCLUB SETTING BECAME TRANSCENDENT YOUTUBE MOST STIRRING WAS MYA BYRNE WHO IS EMERGING AS THE WARRIOR THIS CRISIS REQUIRES HAVING RELEASED TWO ANTHEMS ONE WITH PAISLEY FIELDS IN JUST THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS PERFORMING WITH HER ARTISTIC AND LIFE PARTNER SWAN REAL BYRNE COMMANDED THE STAGE LIKE A STCENTURY ROLLING STONE SHE FINISHED BY EMBRACING REAL IN A TRULY EPIC KISS AFTER WHICH REAL DECLARED THATS TRANS LOVE PEOPLE TRANS PEOPLE ARE EASY TO LOVE THE GESTURE FELT VISCERAL RISKY SEXY HAPPENING SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LONG PARADE OF PEOPLE LIVING TRUTH AND SINGING ABOUT IT IT WAS THE KIND OF CATHARSIS THAT DEMANDS REAL ACTION AS A FOLLOWUP AT THE CITY WINERY THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THINGS BEGAN IN A QUIETER BUT NO LESS FULLY VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WAY TWO SHORT SONGWRITERS ROUNDS ORGANIZED BY KELLY AND HOLLY G FEATURED FIRST ALL LGBTQIA SINGERSONGWRITERS AND THEN A STELLAR LINEUP FROM THE BLACK OPRY IVE SEEN SO MANY SIMILAR INTIMATE EXCHANGES AMONG NASHVILLES SONGWRITING ELITE BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL  AND CASUAL  QUEERNESS AND BLACKNESS OF THESE TWO BUILT A NEW MUSIC CITY ON THAT STAGE STANDOUT PERFORMANCES INCLUDED CHRIS HOUSMANS ODE TO A DRAG QUEEN WHOS NEVER A DRAG AND THE ROUSING TESTIMONY OF THE BLACK OPRYS ALLY FREE A TRANS PERFORMER WHO SHOUTED OUT HIS MOM IN THE AUDIENCE AND SANG OF SURVIVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS BUILDING A CHORUS AROUND THE PHRASE IM NOT GIVING UP JUST YET HE RECEIVED A STANDING OVATION THESE ROUNDS SHOWED THAT THE ONLY WAY A REAL PARADIGM SHIFT CAN HAPPEN IS THROUGH STRENGTH IN NUMBERS THATS WHAT CHANGES A MARGINALIZED PERSONS AUDIBILITY FROM MUTELY REPRESENTATIVE TO RESOUNDING THE NIGHT PROCEEDED WITH MANY SINGERSONGWRITERS MAKING QUICK APPEARANCES  INCLUDING OUTSTANDING TURNS FROM CHARLESTONS SHE RETURNS FROM WAR AND THE SHINDELLAS AND A PERFECT CLOSER FROM MARY GAUTHIER AND JAIMEE HARRIS DRAG QUEENS IN LIMOUSINES INTERSPERSED WITH THESE WARMLY CONNECTED ARTISTS WERE THOSE PERFORMERS AT THE CENTER OF CURRENT DEBATE  THE TOWERINGLY CHARISMATIC DRAG QUEENS WHO FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE REGULARLY APPEARED AT CITY WINERYS SUNDAY DRAG BRUNCHES SO MANY APPEARED THAT I CANT LIST ALL OF THEIR NAMES YOU CAN FIND THEM HERE THOUGH SUFFICE TO SAY THAT HOST VIVICA STEELE AND HER SISTERS FULLY COMMANDED THE CITY WINERY SPACE STRUTTING AND SNAKING THROUGH THE CROWD COLLECTING TIPS FLIPPING HAIR AND THROWING HANDS TO THE DELIGHT OF THE AUDIENCE IT WAS IN TRUTH A STRANGE JUXTAPOSITION  THE QUIET SINGERSONGWRITERS AND THE CLAMOROUSLY OUT DRAG PERFORMERS  YET IT MADE PERFECT SENSE THIS IS NASHVILLE A CITY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS WELCOMING NATURE BUT WHOSE ACCEPTANCE OF QUEER CULTURE HAS TAKEN TIME A LOT OF WORK AND THE WILL TO SET ASIDE STYLISTIC AND OTHER PERSONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE NAME OF UPLIFTING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IN A STATE LIKE TENNESSEE WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE SMALLER THAN SAY IN NEW YORK AND WHERE OPPOSITIONAL FORCES DONT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ONE KIND OF LGBTQIA PERSONA AND ANOTHER SURPRISING ALLIANCES ARE CENTRAL TO SURVIVAL  THE WE WILL ALWAYS BE BENEFIT FOR THE APTLY NAMED INCLUSION TENNESSEE MADE MANIFEST THE SPIRIT THAT KEEPS ACTIVISTS GOING EVEN IN A STATE LIKE TENNESSEE WHERE QUEER LIVES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY DEEPLY UNDERACKNOWLEDGED ITS STILL CRUCIAL TO ADDRESS DIFFERENCES AND POWER DYNAMICS BUT JUST AS I SAW IN ALABAMA AT THESE SHOWS I WITNESSED PEOPLE LOOKING BEYOND THEIR OWN SMALL CIRCLES AND IN DOING SO CHANGING THE BASELINE OF WHO CAN BE SEEN AND HEARD AND WHAT CAN BE SAID INTERSECTIONALITY VIVICA THE NIGHTS EMCEE SHOUTED AT ONE POINT EXECUTING A HIGH LEG KICK THAT WORD MAY BE AS OVERUSED AND MISUNDERSTOOD AS VISIBILITY THESE DAYS BUT IN THAT MOMENT IT GLOWED IN THE DARK FACEBOOKTWITTERFLIPBOARDEMAILREAD  LISTENHOMENEWSCULTUREMUSICPODCASTS

 THE OPENING SONG AND TITLE TRACK OF NICKEL CREEKS FIFTH STUDIO ALBUM CELEBRANTS POSES A STRIKING IMAGE HEAVENS ALWAYS BEEN IN THIS CATHEDRAL THAT WE REBUILD NIGHTLY TOGETHER THE LINE CONJURES THE FANTASTICAL AND THE SPIRITUAL BUT AT ITS HEART THE SONG CELEBRATES SOMETHING SIMPLE EVEN ORDINARY CHOOSING TO COME TOGETHER IN COMMUNITY ITS AN IDEA MADE QUIETLY RADICAL NOT JUST BY ITS ORIGIN  THE BELOVED ACOUSTIC BAND WROTE THE BULK OF CELEBRANTS DURING THE ISOLATION OF COVID LOCKDOWN  BUT ALSO FOR THE CONTEXT INTO WHICH ITS BEING RELEASED A TIME LARGELY DEFINED BY BITTER DEEPLY ENTRENCHED DIVISION CELEBRANTS IS NICKEL CREEKS FIRST RELEASE SINCE ITS  ALBUM A DOTTED LINE WHICH ITSELF CAME AFTER ANOTHER LENGTHY HIATUS DURING WHICH THE TRIO  COMPRISING CHRIS THILE SARA WATKINS AND SEAN WATKINS  DEVELOPED SOLO CAREERS AND OTHER PROJECTS ALL AFTER SPENDING THEIR YOUTH LITERALLY REWRITING ROOTS MUSICAT FIRST LISTEN CELEBRANTS MAY SEEM LIKE THE TRIOS LEAST ACCESSIBLE RECORD FAVORING MUSICAL WORLDBUILDING OVER PLAYLISTREADY SINGLESTHE GORGEOUS HARMONIES AND INTRICATE MUSICIANSHIP OF THOSE EARLIER LPS ARE THERE  IN FACT THE TRIO SOUNDS AND PLAYS BETTER THAN EVER  BUT THE ALBUMS STRUCTURE DOESNT LEND ITSELF TO SKIPPING AROUND INSTEAD CELEBRANTS IS THE KIND OF ALBUM THAT TRULY REWARDS REPEATED FRONTTOBACK LISTENS AND THAT WAS BY DESIGN  RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUAL SONGS THE BAND WROTE THE LP AS ONE MIGHT WRITE A NOVEL ENSURING THAT EACH TRACK HELPED TO CONTEXTUALIZE THOSE BEFORE AND AFTER IT YOUTUBE AT ITS HEART CELEBRANTS IS A RECORD ABOUT HUMAN CONNECTION THERES THE CONNECTION FOUND IN THAT CATHEDRAL  THE COLLECTIVE JOY OF A CONCERT PERHAPS OR THE AWKWARD BUT NECESSARY SMALL TALK OF A PARTY AS RECREATED ON THE DIZZYING SECOND SONG STRANGERS BUT THERES ALSO THE SEEMINGLY SMALLER ONES THE RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS THAT GROUND US THAT RECONNECT US TO PAST VERSIONS OF OURSELVES AND TO BORROW A LINE FROM STANDOUT TRACK HOLDING PATTERN HOLD US AS THE WORLD BURNS DOWN ACCORDINGLY CELEBRANTS ALSO TEASES THE POLITICAL OUT OF THE PERSONAL HOLDING PATTERN BRINGS TO LIFE THE CRACKLING FEAR AND DISORIENTING PARANOIA OF EARLY LOCKDOWN WITH THILE SINGING HIS VOICE UNCHARACTERISTICALLY DOWNCAST ONE MANS FREEDOMS ANOTHERS FEVER THAT KEEPS RISING THE PAIR OF GODDAMNED SAINT AND GODDAMNED SAINT REPRISE FIRST CELEBRATES HOW MUSIC CAN TEAR DOWN IDEOLOGICAL WALLS  A TRICKLE OF LIGHT SHONE IN FROM WHERE I HADNT BEEN  BUT ALSO CHARTS HOW SUCH WALLS ARE BUILT I FIND MY CHOIR HAS CEASED TO THINK AND MY THOUGHTS HAVE CEASED TO SING  CAUSE I WONT EVEN HAVE A DRINK WITH ANYONE WHO DISAGREES  NPR MUSICS  THE YEAR FOLK BROKE HOW NICKEL CREEK MADE AMERICANA THE NEW INDIE ROCKIN A PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE ALBUM SEAN WATKINS SHARED THAT THE BAND WANTED CELEBRANTS TO BE ITS MOST AMBITIOUS RELEASE YET AND IT IS ACROSS  INTERCONNECTED TRACKS NICKEL CREEK OFFERS ANOTHER WORLD FOR LISTENERS NOT NECESSARILY ONE TO ESCAPE INTO  THESE SONGS ARE NUANCED AND HONEST NOT FANTASY  BUT ONE SUITED FOR INTROSPECTION THE TRIPTYCH OF WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE PART  THE MEADOW AND THINNEST WALL ILLUSTRATES SCENARIOS THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO ANYONE IN A LONGTERM PARTNERSHIP WHERE THE LONG LINE LEADS WHICH BOASTS ONE OF SARA WATKINS FINEST VOCALS TO DATE AND HOLLYWOOD ENDING CHALLENGE OUR NEED FOR ATTENTION WITHIN AN ECONOMY THAT LITERALLY PROFITS OFF IT AND CLOSER FAILURE ISNT FOREVER ENDS THE LP ON A HOPEFUL NOTE THOUGH NOT ONE WITHOUT AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT FAILURES ARENT FOREVER UNLESS THEY QUIT WONDERING HOW TO GET BETTER FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES THE THREE MEMBERS OF NICKEL CREEK JOINED A VIDEO CHAT TO TALK ABOUT GETTING BACK TOGETHER TO MAKE CELEBRANTS HONORING EACH OTHERS PERSPECTIVES AND STAYING OPEN TO CHANGE THIS INTERVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED FOR LENGTH AND CLARITY BRITTNEY MCKENNA THIS IS THE LONGEST HIATUS BETWEEN ALBUMS YOUVE TAKEN THUS FAR WHAT IS IT LIKE TO COME BACK TOGETHER TO USE A CLICH IS IT LIKE RIDING A BIKE SARA WATKINS INTERPERSONALLY AND MUSICALLY ITS ALWAYS FELT LIKE A REALLY NATURAL THING TO STEP BACK INTO AND OVER THE YEARS WEVE ALL KEPT IN TOUCH AND SEEN EACH OTHER AT FESTIVALS AND GIGS AND ALWAYS THOUGHT AND EXPECTED TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE MORE MUSIC BUT A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE TIME TO DO IT AND WHENEVER WE DO HAVE THAT TIME THINGS FALL INTO PLACE QUITE QUICKLY  SEAN WATKINS AS SOON AS WE GET TOGETHER IT FEELS LIKE THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE LAST NIGHT WE HUNG OUT EVEN IF THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COUPLE YEARS CHRIS THILE IT STILL SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME THAT ITS THE LONGEST PERIOD BETWEEN RECORDS FOR US IT DOESNT FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL I WONDER IF PEOPLE WHO HAVENT BEEN IN THE SAME BAND SINCE THEY WERE  YEARS OLD CAN RELATE TO THE WAY THAT SOMETIMES YOU FORGET TO PRIORITIZE HANGING OUT WITH YOUR VERY BEST FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT RELATIONSHIP ISNT GOING ANYWHERE THEN WHEN WE FINALLY DID GET IT ON THE BOOKS WHICH TOOK A GLOBAL PANDEMIC ALL OF THE SUDDEN WE STARTED REALIZING HOW MUCH WE HAD TO SAY TOGETHER SEAN WATKINS WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT INITIALLY YOU GUYS AT NPR HAVE NO SMALL ROLE IN THIS CHRIS THILE THATS TRUE SEAN WATKINS THAT PIECE THAT CELEBRATED THE TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FIRST SELFTITLED ALBUM IT HAD US FEELING NOSTALGIC SARA WATKINS NONE OF US HAD REALIZED THE ANNIVERSARY WAS COMING UP SEAN WATKINS SHORTLY AFTER I CANT REMEMBER WHO BROUGHT IT UP BUT THERE WAS A GENERAL SENSE OF LIKE SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING AND THAT STARTED OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT MAKING THIS ALBUM ENLARGE THIS IMAGE                ITS LIKE IF THERES A SCULPTURE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM THILE EXPLAINS OF THE SONGWRITING PROCESS AND YOUVE GOT THREE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND IT YOU NEED ALL OF THEIR DESCRIPTIONS TO UNDERSTAND IT AS A WHOLE

THE TRIOS MOST AMBITIOUS RECORD YET WHAT DID AMBITIOUS MEAN TO YOU IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS RECORD CHRIS THILE WE BOOKED A BUNCH OF TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND OUR FAMILIES ALL THREE OF US BROUGHT OUR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND CHILDREN TO THIS BIG OLD HOUSE IN SANTA BARBARA AND WE STARTED WRITING THE KIDS WERE TOOLING AROUND THE DOGS WERE TOOLING AROUND TOGETHER WED ALL HAVE BIG FAMILY DINNERS TOGETHER AND THEN SARA SEAN AND I WOULD SPEND THE DAY WORKING ON VARIOUS IDEAS AND THEN SPEND THE NIGHTS AFTER THE FAMILIES WOULD GO TO BED DREAMING ABOUT WHAT THE THING COULD BE THE LONGER THAT PROCESS WENT ON THE BIGGER THE IDEA BECAME WE WERE ABLE TO FANTASIZE ABOUT TAKING A REAL BIG SWING AT SOMETHING THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU COULD KIND OF POKE AROUND IN IT LIKE ONE OF THESE GREAT VIDEO GAMES WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOURE INSIDE OF A LITTLE WORLD THATS AN INTERESTING IDEA TREATING THE ALBUM AS A WORLD THE LISTENER CAN ENTER SOME OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS FEEL THAT WAY AND I NOTICED IT WHILE LISTENING TO CELEBRANTS SONGS CALL BACK TO ONE ANOTHER LYRICALLY OR REINTRODUCE MUSICAL FLOURISHES IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOURE REFLECTING WHILE YOURE LISTENING CHRIS THILE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO MUSIC NOW IS SO FRAGMENTED WE GET THINGS IN FITS AND STARTS ITS SO EASY TO FINISH A SONG AND PUT IT OUT AND HAVE PEOPLE START PLAYLISTING IT HALF THE TIME THEYRE ON SHUFFLE AND THEY DONT EVEN MEAN TO BE IF YOURE GOING TO MAKE A RECORD I FEEL THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONCRETE REASON LIKE THE CONTENT NEEDS TO DICTATE THE FORM AN LP IS JUST NOT HOW PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING MUSIC NOW SO IF YOURE MAKING A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO CREATE WITHIN THAT FORM THERE MUST BE A REASON IT SEEMS YOU TOOK GREAT CARE IN SEQUENCING CELEBRANTS LIKE THE WAY THE MEADOW LEADS INTO THINNEST WALL  ALL THE MARRIED FOLKS OUT THERE WILL ESPECIALLY GET THAT ONE THOSE MOMENTS OF BUILDING AND GUIDING ARE ALL OVER THE RECORD HOW DID YOU PULL THAT OFF SARA WATKINS AS WE WERE SCHEMING THE BROADER STRUCTURE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE TO HAVE THE SEQUENCE DETERMINED BEFORE GOING IN TO RECORD AND TO BE ABLE TO FORM THE RECORD WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND WE WANTED THE SONGS TO RELATE TO EACH OTHER AND WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE REPRISALS YOU HEAR AND ALSO HAVE THEMES CONNECT WE DIDNT WRITE THE SONGS IN SEQUENCE BUT AS SONGS WERE COMING OUT WE WERE AWARE OF HOW THEY RELATED TO EACH OTHER THAT WAS A REALLY FUN PART OF THE PROCESS THAT WAS NEW TO US IN THIS BAND AND TO WRITE FOR IT WAS REALLY I THINK LIKE EXPLORING THIS WORLD BY EXPLORING OUR OWN LIVES WITH EACH OTHER AND WHAT WERE ALL PROCESSING AND CREATING SOMETHING INSIDE OF IT CHRIS THILE IN A WAY THE SEQUENCING WAS THE WRITING OF IT THE SHAPE OF THE ALBUM WAS DIRECTLY IMPACTING HOW THE SONGS WERE COMPOSED AND HOW THE LYRICS WERE WRITTEN IT WASNT THAT YOU WOULD FINISH A SONG AND THEN DECIDE WHERE IT FIT YOU WOULD START A SONG AND SEE WHAT NARRATIVE SERVICE IT COULD BE AND WHAT IT COULD HELP CONTEXTUALIZE BEST SEAN WATKINS FROM THE VERY FIRST WRITING SESSION UP THROUGH AS FAR AS WE COULD GO IN THE WRITING PROCESS WE WERE REALLY WORKING TO FINETUNE AS MUCH AS WE COULD WITH WHAT TIME WE HAD THE OTHER THING THAT HELPED WITH SEQUENCING WAS BEING ABLE TO RECORD WITH ERIC VALENTINE OUR PRODUCER HE LIKES TO DO A SORT OF PRACTICE SWING AT AN ALBUM ITS A TOUGH THING TO DO BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SOME EXTRA TIME BUT YOU GET A LOT OF INFORMATION FOR AN ALBUM LIKE THIS  WED NEVER DONE AN ALBUM IN THIS WAY BEFORE YOU KNOW SORT OF PIECING TOGETHER AND DREAMING UP HOW THE SONGS WOULD FIT  YOU HAVE TO HEAR HOW IT HAPPENS IN A REAL WAY SO WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BY RECORDING THE WHOLE ALBUM IN A ROUGH STATE WHEN IT CAME TIME TO RECORD THE ALBUM HOW DID YOUR TIME SPENT WORKING ON OTHER PROJECTS LEND ITSELF TO WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH CREATIVELY AS A UNIT SARA WATKINS I FEEL LIKE I BECAME A MUCH BETTER MUSICIAN WHEN I STARTED PLAYING WITH OTHER BANDS FOR THE LONGEST TIME PERSONALLY WHEN WE WERE DOING NICKEL CREEK SO INTENSELY UP THROUGH WHY SHOULD THE FIRE DIE I HADNT REALLY PLAYED WITH ANYONE ELSE ASIDE FROM JAMMING WITH PEOPLE NICKEL CREEK WAS TAKING UP SO MUCH TIME WHICH IS PART OF WHY WE HAD TO PUT IT ON THE SHELF IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING THERE WAS NO WAY TO DO THE BAND EFFECTIVELY AND TO HAVE A CAREER WITHOUT DOING IT ALL THE TIME AND THAT WORKED REALLY WELL FOR A WHILE THE METAPHOR THAT WE USED FOR A LONG TIME WAS THAT WE HAD BASICALLY FARMED EVERY NUTRIENT WE COULD OUT OF THE POTENTIAL OF THIS BANDS SOIL AND WE NEEDED TO LET IT REST CHRIS THILE WE EACH COME PACKAGED WITH OUR UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE WE BRING THAT TO THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WE ENGAGE IN AND YOU KNOW FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE HAD OUR INDIVIDUAL PERSPECTIVES AND WE HAD THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE THREE OF US BUT NOW THAT WEVE GONE OFF AND DONE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS NOW THE NUANCE OF EVERYONES INDIVIDUAL PERSPECTIVE AND THEN THE COMING TOGETHER OF THE VARIOUS SHADES OF COLOR THAT WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE NOW AS A TRIO IT WOULDNT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT ALL OF OUR GALLIVANTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS NICKEL CREEKS EXTENDED TINY DESK UNIVERSE TINY DESK NICKEL CREEK TINY DESK CONCERT TINY DESK PUNCH BROTHERS TINY DESK CONCERT TINY

DUNCAN TINY DESK CONCERTTO YOUR POINT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT EACH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES BRINGS TO THE BAND DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU EACH HAVE A KIND OF ROLE IN ANY SENSE SEAN WATKINS WE DONT REALLY THINK ABOUT IT OUR PERSPECTIVES ARE BUILT IN WE REALIZE ITS A RARE THING WE KNOW ITS THERE AND THE JOY THAT HAPPENS AND THAT WE ALL FEEL WHEN WE COME TOGETHER THATS THE FUEL CHRIS THILE ITS LIKE IN  LORD OF THE RINGS OR SOMETHING  PEOPLE TAKE TURNS ON WATCH THERE ARE ALL OF THESE ROLES AND YOU CYCLE IN AND OUT I PARTICULARLY THINK ABOUT WHOEVERS LOOKOUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO KEEP THAT CYCLING FOR EVERYONE TO STAY ENERGIZED ONE OF THE THREE OF US MIGHT RUN POINT FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THE OTHER ONE DOES ITS LIKE IF THERES A SCULPTURE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM YOU KNOW AND YOUVE GOT THREE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND IT YOU NEED ALL OF THEIR DESCRIPTIONS TO UNDERSTAND IT AS A WHOLE AT THE TOP OF OUR CONVERSATION YOU ALL NOTED HOW THE PANDEMIC AFFORDED YOU THE TIME TO MAKE THIS RECORD I COULD HEAR INKLINGS OF THE PANDEMIC LYRICALLY ON THE ALBUM TOO IN SONGS LIKE HOLDING PATTERN AND TO THE AIRPORT WOVEN INTO THIS BROADER MEDITATION ON HUMAN CONNECTION DOES THE IDEA OF THE PANDEMIC CREEPING INTO THE LP RESONATE AT ALL CHRIS THILE ONE OF THOSE SONGS ABSOLUTELY THE OTHER ONE ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT I THINK THATS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF MUSIC TO CONSTANTLY RECONTEXTUALIZE ITSELF BASED ON THE MOMENT THAT WE EXPERIENCED IT AS MUSIC LOVERS SO YEAH HOLDING PATTERN WAS MUSING OVER QUESTIONS THAT AROSE DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF LOCKDOWN WHEREAS TO THE AIRPORT IS JUST A SONG ABOUT WALKING THROUGH AIRPORTS SEAN WATKINS WITH HOLDING PATTERN THATS A GOOD ONE THAT REPRESENTS WHAT CHRIS WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE SCULPTURE BEING ON DIFFERENT SIDES I HAD THE GUITAR PART AND SOME LYRICS AND THE CHORUS WAS HOLDING PATTERN I PLAYED IT FOR SARA AND CHRIS AND THEY SAW IT FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WHICH WAS WHAT IT ENDED UP BEING HOW WERE ALL FEELING WHEN COVID WAS REALLY FIRING ALL CYLINDERS LOCKED DOWN IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE VAGUE IDEA I HAD GOING INTO IT AND IT WAS SO GREAT  CHRIS THILE SO MUCH OF THE TIME THE PERSON WHO STARTS THE THING HAS THE LEAST PERSPECTIVE ON IT THATS WHY I LOVE BEING IN A BAND AND THEN ALSO WITH YOU AS THE MUSIC LISTENER NOW GETTING TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AS YOURE INTERVIEWING US ABOUT IT YOU HAVE MORE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS THAN WE DO KNOW AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YOURE HEARING WHATS THERE WE KNOW WHAT WE MEANT BUT YOURE HEARING WHATS ACTUALLY THERE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERES SO MUCH LETTING GO INVOLVED YOU LET GO OF AN INDIVIDUAL IDEA TO THE GROUP LET GO OF REVISING WHEN ITS TIME TO RECORD THEN FULLY LET GO ONCE THE MUSIC IS RELEASED ITS NOT YOURS ANYMORE SARA WATKINS THE LETTING GO PROCESS WAS ONGOING ON THIS ALBUM I THINK BECAUSE OF THE SEQUENCING THAT WE WANTED TO HOLD TRUE TO WE TRIED TO BE OPEN TO ADJUSTING ANYTHING UNTIL WE RECORDED IT WE WERE OPEN TO RECONSIDERING LYRICS THERE WERE MANY PARTS THAT WE JUST KEPT APPROACHING BECAUSE ONE OF US WAS NOT REALLY SATISFIED WITH IT A SONG WAS NEVER CONSIDERED LIKE OK WERE DONE WITH THAT WERE NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY RECORDED IT THAT OPENNESS YOURE TALKING ABOUT  HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE SPIRIT OF THE BAND IS IT SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN STRONGER WITH TIME AND AGE SARA WATKINS I DONT THINK WE HAD THAT FOR A LONG TIME SEAN WATKINS WEVE NEVER REALLY HAD THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT ALSO YEAH I THINK PERSONALLY AS YOU GROW UP YOU LEARN TO HOLD LOOSELY TO YOUR IDEAS AS YOU GET OLDER YOU CAN KIND OF KEEP YOUR EGO MORE IN CHECK AND NOT IDENTIFY SO MUCH WITH YOUR IDEAS A PAIR OF SONGS I KEPT THINKING ABOUT WERE GODDAMNED SAINT AND GODDAMNED SAINT REPRISE THE FIRST TRACK TELLS THIS STORY OF ONES WORLD BEING MADE LARGER BY MUSIC BUT THEN VEERS INTO DARKER TERRITORY THAT MIRRORS TODAYS POLITICAL CLIMATE ITS REPRISAL SEEMS TO RETAIN THAT DARKNESS BUT THEN TAKES A TURN FOR THE LIGHT WHEN THE NARRATOR PASSES THE TORCH TO A YOUNGER GENERATION CHRIS THILE THAT ONE STARTED WITH JUST THAT LITTLE SOARING MELODY THE FIRST TIME WE WORKED ON IT THE PLACE WE WERE IN HAD SUPER HIGH CEILINGS I STARTED SINGING THAT MELODY AND SARAH DOUBLED IT KIND OF JUST REFLEXIVELY AT THE OCTAVE AND YOU ONLY HEAR THAT AT THE VERY VERY END OF THE SONG BUT WE KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO GET THERE WE TRIED STARTING WITH AND ITS LIKE THERES NOWHERE TO GO ITS SUCH A BIG MOMENT THAT WE KNEW WE WERE NOT GOING TO START THERE WERE GOING TO END THERE WE NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE WE NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EARN THAT MOMENT AND THE TOPIC HAS TO BE RANGEY TO GET TO THIS MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN FEEL WEVE EARNED THAT CATHARSIS THAT MOMENT THATS WHEN WE SAY IVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE WELL IVE DRAWN FROM SPRINGS FROM DISAGREEMENTS WITH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ONLY CHANGE SOMEONE AS MUCH AS WERE WILLING TO BE CHANGED ITS ONE OF THE MOST BALDFACED LYRICS IVE EVER BEEN A PART OF ITS SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RECORD AND SUMMARIZES WHATS BEEN GOING SO FAR AND PUTS A BIG GIANT QUESTION MARK CAN WE REOPEN OUR PERSPECTIVES CAN WE GET BACK SOMEHOW TO THAT NAVE PLACE WHEN WE WOULD ENTER INTO A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WE DISAGREE WITH IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE THATS HOW WE GOT TO THESE CONVICTIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW AND HOLD SO DEAR AND TREAT AS BEING SO SACRED CAN WE STILL DO THATYOUTUBE THATS THE MILLIONDOLLAR QUESTION OR PERHAPS BILLIONDOLLAR THESE DAYS WHERE THE LONG LINE LEADS AND HOLLYWOOD ENDING ALSO FELT LIKE THEMATIC SIBLINGS TO ME THE WAY THEY EACH ADDRESS THE PITFALLS OF CHASING FAME AND LIVING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA THE LATTER OF WHICH WASNT REALLY A THING WHEN YOU ALL FIRST STARTED OUT HOW DO THE OBSERVATIONS THOSE SONGS POSE RELATE TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES IN THE PUBLIC EYE SARA WATKINS I IMAGINE THAT EVERYBODY ENCOUNTERS IT TO SOME TO SOME DEGREE RIGHT THIS IS JUST THE WORLD WE LIVE IN ITS JUST GO GO GO MORE MORE MORE AND ITS NEVER ENOUGH WITH HOLLYWOOD ENDING THERES A LOT OF CONNECTION TO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WE WROTE A LOT OF THIS RECORD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE ALL FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT IMAGERY COMES OUT IN A LOT OF WAYS ON THE RECORD AND DEFINITELY ON LONG LINE AND I THINK EXACTLY WHEN YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHERE ITS LARGELY COMING FROM A PLACE OF WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME SO THAT I CAN BE ENOUGH FOR YOU SO THAT I CAN BE ENOUGH FOR ME CHRIS THILE THATS ALSO AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THE RECORD TO SET UP THE IDEA THAT WERE REALLY EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF STAYING OPEN TO CHANGE ITS ONE OF THE CENTRAL TENETS OF THE RECORD EMBRACING THAT KIND OF FRICTION THAT LEADS TO PERSONAL AND THEN POTENTIALLY GLOBAL CHANGE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOURE LOOKING AT IT FROM ALL SIDES LONG LINE IS OBVIOUSLY A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT CHANGING YOURSELF TO ATTRACT GREATER ATTENTION OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THATS SOMETHING WERE ALL QUITE WARY OF AT THIS POINT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SONG THAT THROWS A LITTLE BIT OF A WRENCH INTO THE GRAND THEMES OF THE RECORD SEAN WATKINS ALL THE SONGS WERE VULNERABLE THE WHOLE TIME THAT CAN BE AN UNSETTLING FEELING BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE IT CAN BE REALLY EXCITINGCHRIS THILESARA WATKINSNICKEL

HIPHOP IS  AS A BGIRL  YOU KNOW BEING OUT THERE BREAK DANCING WATCHING YOUNG KIDS MOVE AROUND THROUGHOUT THE BRONX TRAVELING AS NOMADIC BGIRLS AND BBOYS JUST TO HIT THOSE BREAKBEATS THE MCING CAME IN  THE FIRST PERSON THAT I SAW BREAKDANCE WAS FRIENDS OF MINE THAT HAD WENT TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WITH ME THEY TAUGHT ME WHAT IT WAS TO UPROCK WHAT IT WAS TO JUST HIT THE BEATS WHENEVER YOU HEAR THAT CERTAIN BREAK BEAT  FROM THERE YOU KNOW I USED TO TRAVEL AND WATCH THE FAMOUS TWINS PERFORM BACK THEN WERE CALLED THE N TWINS NOW THEY ARE CALLED THE LEGENDARY BROTHERS KEITH AND KEVIN I USED TO TRAVEL AROUND WITH THEM TO BGIRL TO EVERY PARK JAM EVERY DJ THAT PLAYED EVERY HOUSE PARTY EVERY HIPHOP VENUE I TRAVELED ALL OVER THE BRONX JUST TO BE A PART OF THE WHOLE SCENE  THE CIRCLE WAS ALWAYS MALEDOMINATED IT WAS A YOUNG MALE SPORT AT THE TIME I WAS SORT OF LIKE A TOMBOY GROWING UP BUT THERE WAS JUST A FEELING THAT YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO BE A PART OF SOME OF US WAS LIVING IN POVERTY POLITICIANS ALWAYS DOING THEIR OWN THING SO WHEN WE CAME WITHIN THAT CIRCLE THAT WAS OUR WAY TO GET AWAY FROM ALL THE OTHER NEGATIVE STUFF I MEAN JUST BEING OUT THERE IN THE STREET AND JUST LISTENING TO SOME OF THIS THE SOUNDS AND THE MUSIC AND THE PERCUSSION  IT JUST GAVE YOU A FEELING LIKE YOU COULD JUST TAKE ON THE WORLD IT JUST EMPOWERED YOU AS A WOMAN A YOUNG MAN THAT WAS A PART OF THE ORGANIZATION CALLED THE BROTHERS DISCO WORK WAS PASSING OUT FLYERS HE SAID LISTEN YOU KNOW WERE HAVING AN AUDITION WOULD YOU WANNA COME AND AUDITION FOR MC I SAID SURE WHY NOT THE AUDITION WAS HELD IN THE BASEMENT AT DJ BREAKOUTS HOUSE AND SO I TOOK A FRIEND WITH ME UPTOWN IN THE BRONX AND AUDITIONED EVERYBODY UPTOWN KNEW WHERE HE WORKED WHERE HE LIVED AND SO IT WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE I HAD TO GO HOME FROM SCHOOL THAT DAY I WROTE THE RHYME ON THE BUS AND JUST RECITED IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN HEADING BACK UPTOWN AND I WON THE PART THERE WAS NO OTHER GIRL MCS AUDITIONING BUT BECAUSE THEY LOVED THE WAY THAT I WROTE MY RHYME AND HOW MY CADENCE WAS I BECAME THE MC FOR THE ORGANIZATION ENLARGE THIS IMAGE                FLYERS FOR EARLY HIPHOP EVENTS FEATURING SHAROCK INCLUDING ONE AS A MEMBER

THE FIRST FEMALE MC BUT AT THE TIME THERE WERE ONLY TWO MALE MCS IN THE ORGANIZATION  KEITH KEITH AND KK ROCKWELL AND THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF  WE ADD ANOTHER MC TO THE GROUP RAHIEM THIS IS HOW WE BECAME THE ORIGINAL FUNKY   THEN YOU HAD THE FURIOUS FOUR WHICH WAS GRANDMASTER FLASHS GROUP THEY HAD FOUR MALE MEMBERS SO THE FUNKY  AND THE FURIOUS FOUR  BEFORE WE BECAME THE FUNKY    AND BEFORE THEY BECAME THE FURIOUS FIVE  WE CREATED THE FIRST RAP BATTLES IN THE HISTORY OF HIPHOP CULTURE THAT MEANS GROUPS GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER I WAS THE FIRST AND THE ONLY FEMALE MC TO EVER BATTLE ANYBODY I WAS ALWAYS A SECRET WEAPON IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH MY GROUP A LOT OF OTHER GROUPS WERE SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIND FEMALE MCS THAT CAN BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SHAROCK I NEVER FELT NO KIND OF WAY BECAUSE MY GROUP HAD ALWAYS LET PEOPLE KNOW OUT THERE IN NEW YORK CITY OR WHEREVER WE TRAVEL  WHETHER IT WAS CONNECTICUT WASHINGTON DC ANY PLACE UP AND DOWN THE I CORRIDOR  THAT MC SHAROCK WAS THE BEST FEMALE MC AND THAT THEY HAD THE BEST FEMALE MC EVER ONE DAY WE HAD A BATTLE AND WE COME TO FIND OUT THAT RAHIEM FROM OUR GROUP WAS THINKING ABOUT GOING OVER TO THE FURIOUS FOUR WE FELT LIKE RAHEIM THREW THE BATTLE BECAUSE HE SAID HE DIDNT WANNA SING  HE WAS THE SINGER AND THE HARMONIZER OF THE GROUP AND SO WE KNEW THAT GRANDMASTER FLASH AND THE FURIOUS FOUR WON BECAUSE OF THAT WE WERE THE ONLY TWO GROUPS IN NEW YORK CITY AT THAT TIME THAT WAS GARNERING ATTENTION AND GETTING EVERYBODY TO COME TO OUR PARTIES SO THE OTHER TWO MEMBERS KICKED HIM OUT OF THE GROUP AND HE WINDS UP GOING TO THE FURIOUS FIVE IN  RAHIEM AND I WERE VERY CLOSE SO I DIDNT KNOW WHAT REALLY WENT DOWN AND SO I LEFT THE GROUP I CAME BACK TO THE GROUP ON THE STRENGTH OF THE MANAGER ASKING ME TO COME BACK THEY HAD GOTTEN TWO NEW MEMBERS SO WHEN I CAME BACK THATS WHEN I BECAME THE PLUS ONE  I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHY THEY CALLED IT FUNKY    AND NOT FUNKY  AT THE TIME IM YOUNG    YEARS OLD  IM JUST SAYING OK WELL IM THE PLUS ONE YEAH ITS ADDED ON I THINK IN THE END IT WAS LIKE A GIFT AND A CURSE WHEN PEOPLE HEAR FUNKY    THEY THINK OF  RAP RECORDS BUT THEY DONT KNOW THE HISTORY BEFORE  OF ME BEING A PART OF THE ORIGINAL FUNKY  ME BEING ON THE STREETS IN NEW YORK PLAYING AT OVER  HIPHOP VENUES ON  FLYERS AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER FEMALE IN THE HISTORY OF HIPHOP CULTURE  I NEVER REALLY LOOKED AT IT AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FUNKY  I THINK WHAT MY MANAGER PROBABLY HAD IN MIND IS THAT HE WANTED TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE FURIOUS FIVE HE JUST WANTED ME TO STAND OUT AND THATS WHY HE CAME UP WITH THE PLUS ONE ENLARGE THIS IMAGE

USED TO HEAR MY VOICE ON CASSETTE TAPES IT WOULD CARRY AND SO THATS WHY YOU WOULD HAVE PEOPLE LIKE DMC FROM RUN DMC USING IT WHEN HE HEARD MY TAPES FLOATING AROUND IN THE STREETS HE TOLD JAM MASTER J I WANT YOU TO MAKE ME SOUND LIKE SHAROCK ON THE ECHO CHAMBER AND SO WHEN YOU HEAR THEM DOING THE TOUGHER THAN LEATHER ALBUM YOU COULD HEAR THE ECHO IN THEIR VOICE EDITORS NOTE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO NOTICED THAT DISTINCT STYLE WAS DARRYL DMC MCDANIELS OF RUNDMC HERES WHAT HE TOLD THE LOUDER TEAM ABOUT SHAROCK SO I HEARD FUNKY    I HEARD THAT AND THEN ON THAT RECORD WAS THIS GIRL AND SINCE IT WAS A GIRL THE VOICE WAS SO DISTINCTIVE BUT IT SOUNDED STRONGER MORE GROUNDED MORE VERSATILE MORE UNIQUE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN ALL OF THE DUDES THAT I HAD HEARD UP TO THAT POINT IT WAS JUST A DIFFERENT ENERGY AND THEY WERE ALL SWITCHING OFF FROM RAPPING BUT WHEN IT GOT TO THE PART WHERE THEY SAID SHAROCK DONT STOP JUST TURN ON YOUR MIC AND YOURE READY TO ROCK AND THIS PERSON I DONT WANNA JUST SAY GIRL THIS PERSON JUST WENT I HEARD HER RHYMING OVER THE BREAK BEAT SEVEN MINUTES OF FUNK AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS JUST THE CRAZIEST THING THAT I EVER HEARD AND I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IT BUT THERE

DELIGHT WHICH WAS THE FIRST BREAKOUT HIT FOR THE SUGARHILL GANG OFF OF SUGAR HILL RECORD LABEL THE SONG CAME OUT IN NOVEMBER ENJOY HAD ALL OF THE TOP MCS THAT WAS ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK PRIOR FOR SOME REASON THERE WAS A SCOUT THAT CAME TO US AND SAID SYLVIA ROBINSON WANTS YALL TO COME OVER TO SUGAR HILL RECORDS MY MANAGER WAS AGAINST IT BUT WE FELT LIKE BECAUSE SHE HAD THE NO  SONG IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME  A RAP SONG  WE FELT LIKE HER MARKETING REACH WAS BETTER THAN ENJOY RECORDS RAPPERS DELIGHT TOPPED THE CHARTS IN CANADA SPAIN AND THE NETHERLANDS AND FINISHED TOP  IN NINE OTHER COUNTRIES BUT PEAKED AT NO  ON THE BILLBOARD HOT   SOMEHOW THE OWNER OF ENJOY BOBBY ROBINSON WORKED SOMETHING OUT WITH SUGAR HILL RECORDS AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET OFF THE LABEL AND SIGN TO SUGAR HILL THAT FOLLOWING YEAR I WAS  GOING ON  BUT THE CRAZY THING ABOUT IT IS THAT MY MOTHER DIDNT EVEN SIGN MY CONTRACT FOR ME MY SISTER SHE WASNT MY LEGAL GUARDIAN BUT SHE SIGNED MY CONTRACT FOR ME BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO IT SO BAD WHEN IT CAME TO SONGS THAT WE RECORDED LIKE RAPPIN AND ROCKING THE HOUSE YOU KNOW WE WENT INTO THE STUDIO AND DID THAT IN ONE TAKE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE USED THE RHYMES THAT WE WERE ALREADY RHYMING TO IN THE PARKS AND THE STREETS IN NEW YORK BEFORE RECORD DEALS THATS THE JOINT  WE WERE ALWAYS DOING ROUTINES THATS WHAT WE WERE KNOWN FOR WE JUST GONNA LET EACH AND EVERY MC RHYME

BE ABLE TO LET PEOPLE SEE WHAT SUGAR HILL RECORDS WAS DOING I MEAN WE HIT EVERY MAJOR CITY THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE EVERY ARENA EVERY PLACE THAT WE PLAYED AT WAS SOLD OUT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WERE COMING BECAUSE YOURE TALKING ABOUT  WHERE RAP MUSIC IS HITTING SHE TOOK THIS RB GROUP SKY THAT WAS OUT THERE WITH US AND SHE TOOK CHARLIE WILSON AND THE GAP BAND WITH US AND THE RAPPING DUMMY WAS OUT THERE WITH US AS WELL AND SO IT WAS THE BEST THING EVER THE FIRST DOCUMENTED HIPHOP TOUR IT WAS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL THE SEQUENCE AND I WERE THE ONLY FEMALES OUT ON THE MAJOR TOURS IN THE BEGINNING OF HIPHOP CULTURE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY OR THE SURROUNDING AREAS  WHEN YOU GOING TO PLACES LIKE WISCONSIN YOU GOING TO PLACES LIKE CHICAGO FLORIDA YOU KNOW PLACES THAT WE NEVER EVEN BEEN BEFORE HIPHOP WAS SOMETHING NEW TO THEM THEY TREATED US LIKE WE WERE THE JACKSONS WHEN IT COMES TO HIPHOP IM VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE CULTURE AND ITS STORIES AND ITS ESSENCE ESPECIALLY THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO IT SO TO BE OUT THERE ON THAT STAGE AND HEAR THE YOUNG TEENAGERS AND THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS JUST ROARING FOR SOMETHING THAT WE YOUNG KIDS BROUGHT TO THEM WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS ENLARGE

THAT TOUR BUS WAS MAD BUT US A LOT OF ANIMOSITY BUILT UP ON THAT TOUR A FIGHT ERUPTED WITH THE FURIOUS FIVE  WE WERE THE TOP GROUPS IN NEW YORK CITY AT THE TIME AND SO ONCE THEY FIND OUT THAT WE WERE GONNA BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE  SO MUCH STUFF HAPPENED WITHIN THOSE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS FIGHTS AND ARGUMENTS ALL THAT STUFF WENT DOWN  IT CAME TO A HEAD IN THE PARKING LOT OF SUGAR HILL RECORDS WE DIDNT KNOW AT THE TIME THE IMPACT OF BEING ON THAT TELEVISION SHOW WE WERE HOOD STARS IN OUR OWN  AREAS PEOPLE KNEW US IN NEW YORK CITY THEY KNEW WHO WE WERE FROM THE TAPES FLOATING AROUND FROM THEM KNOWING WHO THE FUNKY  THE FUNKY    WAS BECAUSE WE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE FIVE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK CITY BUT TO BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AND HAVE THE ENTIRE WORLD HEAR US RHYMING WAS LIKE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER CAME OUR WAY YOU MAY HAVE HAD LIKE KURTIS BLOW AND SUGARHILL GANG ON SOUL TRAIN BUT WE WERE THE FIRST AUTHENTIC HIPHOP GROUP OUT THE STREETS OF NEW YORK TO EVER PERFORM ON NATIONAL TELEVISION THEY WANTED THE FUNKY    BECAUSE WE WAS A GROUP THAT NOT ONLY PLAYED IN PUNKROCK CLUBS WE WERE THE FIRST GROUP TO EVER GO DOWN TO SOHO IN MANHATTAN AND PLAY FOR A DIFFERENT GENRE OF PEOPLE SO BLONDIE WANTED US DEBBIE HARRY THE LEAD SINGER OF THE GROUP WANTED US AND WE WERE TOLD THE REASON WHY SHE WANTED US AS OPPOSED TO GRANDMASTER FLASH AND THE FURIOUS FIVE OR THE SUGARHILL GANG IS BECAUSE WE HAD A FEMALE AND THE FACT THAT WE WERE YOUNG AND INNOCENT LOOKING SO I HAVE TO COMMEND DEBBIE HARRY FOR BRINGING US ON BECAUSE IT ALLOWED US TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT WE WERE DOING BACK IN THE BRONX WHEN DEBBIE HARRY ANNOUNCED US WHAT SHE SAID WAS I GOT THE BEST STREET RAPPERS THE BEST STREET RAPPERS FROM THE BRONX THE FUNKY    WHEN WE WALKED INTO NBC THE SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SET IT WAS LIKE OK WERE GONNA BE ON TV AND I WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME I THINK I WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT SO I WAS LIKE HURTING I WAS FEELING KIND OF CRAZY BUT MY GROUP DIDNT KNOW WE WERE GONNA WORK WITH BLONDIE AND DEBBIE HARRY SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP US GET OFF OUR CONTRACT SHE WAS LIKE WHATEVER YOU DO DONT GO RESIGN IM GONNA HOOK YOU UP WITH OUR ATTORNEYS AND WE ARE GONNA TRY TO GET YOU OFF THE LABEL AND WANT YOU TO TOUR WITH US WE WERE GONNA START RECORDING WITH HER AND EVERYTHING BUT SOME OF US INCLUDING ME MY CRAZY TAIL WENT AND RESIGNED THINKING THAT SYLVIA ROBINSON WAS GONNA DO THE RIGHT THING BY US AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT SHE PROMISED US SHE PROMISED US THAT SHE WAS GONNA PAY US SHE PROMISED THAT SHE WAS GONNA ALLOW US TO RECORD AS MANY SONGS AS WE WANT AND SHE WAS GONNA ENSURE THAT ALL OUR FRUITS OF LABOR WOULD COME TO FRUITION  WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MONETIZE OFF OF THE CULTURE THAT WE CREATED AND SHE PROMISED US THAT BUT IT DIDNT HAPPEN ENLARGE THIS IMAGE

WERE AT THE PEAK OF OUR CAREER AND BECAUSE I WAS PREGNANT WE PROBABLY WOULDNT HAVE GOTTEN AS MUCH WORK  THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE OFF OF SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AFTER WE DID GO ON TELEVISION THATS WHEN THE CRAZINESS STARTED  WITHIN THE GROUP AND WITHIN SUGAR HILL RECORDS WE STARTED BEING PIT AGAINST EACH OTHER LIL RODNEY C WAS BASICALLY LIKE THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE GROUP BUT HE HAD NO FILTER AND HE WOULD SAY WHAT HE FELT WAS RIGHT THAT WAS INTIMIDATING TO SOME OF THE OWNERS AT THE LABEL ITS JUST THAT WE DIDNT FOLLOW HIS LEAD BECAUSE WE OTHER MEMBERS IN THE GROUP FELT LIKE SYLVIA ROBINSON WAS GOING TO DO US RIGHT RODNEY C AND KK ROCKWELL WHO WERE VERY TIGHT WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE GROUP BECAUSE SHE FELT THOSE TWO WERE THE OUTSPOKEN ONES ME KEITH KEITH AND JAZZY JEFF STAYED AT THE TIME BEING PREGNANT WAS A SCARY THING I WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF MY CAREER AS WELL AND I WAS SO NERVOUS NOT BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY BUT NERVOUS TO KNOW THAT IT WOULD PUT A DAMPER ON ME MOVING FORWARD SO I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW I WAS GONNA NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF THIS WITH THE SUPPORT OF MY MOM I WAS ABLE TO AND THEN ONCE I HAD MY DAUGHTER I WAS ABLE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

SHE WAS GONNA LOOK OUT FOR ME BECAUSE I HAD HER GODDAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN IN  I SIGNED MY CONTRACT WITH HER IN  SO THIS IS LIKE THE BEGINNING OF A GOOD RELATIONSHIP SO I FELT LIKE NO MATTER WHAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO BE THE GODMOTHER SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME OR MY MOM  SHES ABLE TO FINANCIALLY TAKE CARE OF HER AND THE FACT THAT THAT WAS MY MONEY MADE FROM MY SONGS SO IT WASNT LIKE I WAS ASKING YOU FOR ANYTHING THAT WAS MY MONEY THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME WHEN I REALIZED THAT NO MONEY WAS COMING IN  IM BROKE GIVEN ALL I HAD ALL MY GOOD SONGS ALL MY GOOD LYRICS TO THESE

          I USUALLY WRITE LISE JETT LAUGHS ITS HARD TO SPEAK ABOUT A VERY EMOTIONAL SUBJECT LIKE THIS ONE THE FREELANCE MUSIC JOURNALIST HAD ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF ARCADE FIRE MORE THAN JUST ONE OF HER FAVORITE BANDS ARCADE FIRE DEFINED HER CAREER THE BAND THAT MADE HER A MUSIC JOURNALIST AS A YOUNG STUDENT AT UNIVERSIT DE SHERBROOKE SHE HAD GONE TO THREE SHOWS BACKTOBACK BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE SUBURBS THE BANDS GRAMMYWINNING RECORD BEING AT THEIR SHOW AT THE TIME HAD THE SAME ENERGY AS BEING AT CHURCH IN FRONT OF A PRIEST JETT SAYS WE WERE ALL THERE IN FRONT OF THEM GLORIFYING THEM THEY WERE I DONT WANT TO SAY GODS BUT THEY WERE SO HIGHLY RESPECTED AND LOVED SINCE FORMING IN  ARCADE FIRE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST GEMS IN MONTRALS MUSICAL CROWN LED BY WIN BUTLER AN AMERICAN WHO GREW UP IN TEXAS AND RGINE CHASSAGNE A FRANCOPHONE QUBCOISE WITH HAITIAN ROOTS THE BAND SYMBOLIZES THE REALITY FOR MANY MONTRALAIS AND MONTRALAISES LIVING IN A CITY THAT MIXES FRENCH AND ENGLISH IN EVERY ASPECT OF ITS BEING A CITY WHERE PEOPLE COME TO FIND THEMSELVES THROUGH COLD WINTERS AND HOT SUMMERS THROUGH LANGUAGE BARRIERS THAT ARE ERASED IN GATHERINGS LIVING IN A CITY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS CULTURAL SCENE AND MOSTLY ITS MUSIC WHETHER IT IS PRODUCED IN FRENCH OR ENGLISH FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES ARCADE FIRE HAS BEEN THE MOST VISIBLE EXPORT OF THAT SCENE BUT SINCE THE END OF AUGUST THE MONTRAL MUSIC SCENE HAS HAD TO RECKON WITH SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BUTLER TO QUOTE PITCHFORKS SHOCKING INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THREE WOMEN ALLEGED SEXUAL INTERACTIONS WITH BUTLER THAT THEY CAME TO FEEL WERE INAPPROPRIATE GIVEN THE GAPS IN AGE POWER DYNAMICS AND CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY OCCURRED THE STORY ALSO ALLEGED THAT BUTLER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED A FOURTH PERSON WHO IS GENDERFLUID TWICE IN  WHEN THEY WERE  AND HE WAS  IN A RESPONSE COMMUNICATED THROUGH NEW YORKBASED CRISIS PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPERT RISA HELLER BUTLER ACKNOWLEDGED THE SEXUAL INTERACTIONS BUT CLAIMED THEY WERE CONSENSUAL WHILE THESE RELATIONSHIPS WERE ALL CONSENSUAL I AM VERY SORRY TO ANYONE WHO I HAVE HURT WITH MY BEHAVIOR BUTLER WROTE AS I LOOK TO THE FUTURE I AM CONTINUING TO LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES AND WORKING HARD TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON SOMEONE MY SON CAN BE PROUD OF  IM SORRY I WASNT MORE AWARE AND TUNED IN TO THE EFFECT I HAVE ON PEOPLE  I F UP AND WHILE NOT AN EXCUSE I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD AND HEAL WHAT CAN BE HEALED AND LEARN FROM PAST EXPERIENCES IN NOVEMBER A FIFTH WOMAN CAME FORWARD TO ALLEGE AN ONGOING ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WHILE MANY OUTLETS REPORTED THE NEWS RIGHT AWAY AND HAD EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE REACTION IN CANADA SEEMED DELAYED THIS WASNT THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE FROM THE CANADIAN MUSIC SCENE HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND PROBABLY WOULDNT BE THE LAST HOWEVER THIS SITUATION FELT ESPECIALLY DIRE BUTLER IS A STAR WHO BOTH ENABLED AND TROUBLED THE GROWTH OF A SCENE THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED GLOBALLY FOR ITS CREATIVE TALENT HE REPRESENTED SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST A BELOVED HOMETOWN ARTIST  HES AN INTERNATIONAL STAR WHO HELPED EARN THE MONTRAL SCENE A GLOBAL REPUTATION JETTS STORY COULD BE THE STORY OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN MONTRAL EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN THE CITY HAS A STORY ABOUT THE BAND BUT SINCE THE ALLEGATIONS CAME TO LIGHT ARCADE FIRE HAS BECOME A SYNONYM FOR SOMETHING DARKER SOMETHING EVEN THE PEOPLE EVOLVING AROUND THEM COULDNT SEE COMING THIS TIME AROUND THE QUESTION LINGERED HOW AND WHY DID THIS HAPPEN IN QUBEC WE GLORIFY THEM OLIVIER LALANDE IS NO STRANGER TO THE MONTRAL MUSIC SCENE BEFORE WORKING AS AN ONLINE CONTENT EDITOR HE WAS A MUSIC JOURNALIST AND ONE OF THE FIRST TO INTERVIEW ARCADE FIRE BEFORE ITS BIG BREAK AROUND THIS TIME IN  THERE WAS ALREADY A CULT AROUND THEM IN THE UNDERGROUND SCENE LALANDE SAYS I WAS A FREELANCE MUSIC JOURNALIST IN CHARGE OF THE MUSIC SECTION OF NIGHTLIFE AND I USED TO SPEND TIME ON A FORUM CALLED MONTRAL SHOWS THIS FORUM IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED EVERY TIME ARCADE FIRE WOULD PERFORM PEOPLE WOULD GO NUTS I WAS CURIOUS AFTER THE RELEASE OF ITS FIRST ALBUM FUNERAL IN  THE BAND QUICKLY GAINED ATTENTION FROM MAINSTREAM MEDIA ACROSS THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING YEAR DAVID CARR ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT POP CULTURE COLUMNISTS IN THE UNITED STATES PROFILED MONTRAL FOR HIS NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN CARR DESCRIBED THE CITY AS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR A CREATIVE OUTOFTHEORDINARY MUSIC SCENE BEING THE BIGGEST DESTINATION FOR MUSIC IN A REGION ALMOST GUARANTEES AN INFLUX OF MUSICALLY INCLINED DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE TO BOTH PLAY IN AND LISTEN TO BANDS BAD WEATHER HELPS BECAUSE IT KEEPS SONGWRITERS INSIDE AND BANDS REHEARSING AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY A NASCENT MUSICAL SCENE REQUIRES LOTS OF CHEAP REAL ESTATE FOR MUSICIANS AND THEIR FANS TO HANG OUT AND PLAY IN CARRS ARTICLE FOR THE MOST PART EXISTED BECAUSE OF ARCADE FIRES NEWFOUND GLORY ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE IN THE NEARLY TWO DECADES SINCE THE BANDS RELEASED SIX ALBUMS TOTAL PERFORMED ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE FIVE TIMES AND TOURED INTERNATIONALLY IN  THE SUBURBS WON THE POLARIS MUSIC PRIZE AS WELL AS ALBUM OF THE YEAR FOR BOTH THE JUNO AWARDS AND THE RD GRAMMY AWARDS WHEN YOUD WALK AROUND MONTRAL AND SAW MEMBERS OF ARCADE FIRE ON THE STREET YOU WOULD FEEL EXTREMELY SPECIAL JETT SAYS YOU KNOW WE QUBCOIS AND QUBCOISE PEOPLE HAVE THIS CONNECTION WITH OUR ARTISTS THERES CULTURAL BELONGING AS SOON AS SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM OUR HOME SHINES ABROAD WE GO CRAZY WEVE DONE IT WITH CLINE DION AND WEVE DONE IT WITH XAVIER DOLAN WEVE DONE IT WITH MANY ARTISTS OUR QUBEC TV SERIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO MANY LANGUAGES A LOT OF QUBEC CULTURE IS FOUND ELSEWHERE BECAUSE IT IS DISTINCT FROM CANADA IT HAS A COLOR IT HAS A PARTICULAR FLAVOR WHEN WE SUCCEED GLOBALLY IT MAKES US EXPONENTIALLY PROUD HERE IN QUBEC JETTS WORDS ARE ECHOED BY LALANDE WHO CONFIRMS THE GODLIKE STATE OF ARTISTS IN THE FRENCHSPEAKING PROVINCE LALANDE MENTIONS HOW ALBUMS ARE ANNOUNCED IN THE PROVINCE INSTEAD OF A SORTIR RELEASE ARTISTS OFFRIR OFFERING AS IF THEY WERE GIFTING US THEIR TALENT RATHER THAN RELEASING THEIR WORK LOOK AT ANY VARIETY SHOW IN QUBEC LALANDE EXPLAINS EVERY TIME THERES A POPULAR ARTIST WHOS A GUEST IT FEELS LIKE  CHRIST HAS COME BACK TO DELIVER US FROM OUR SINS I KNOW IM EXAGGERATING BUT THERES A LOT OF THIS WE GLORIFY THEM THE HEAVY RELIGIOUS LINGO IS NO MISTAKE FRENCHCANADIAN CATHOLIC HISTORY LOOMS LARGE IN QUBEC BUT THAT LANGUAGE HAS OVER TIME COME TO DESCRIBE CULTURAL PRODUCTS TOO THIS UNDERLINES A BIGGER ISSUE THE SYSTEMATIC GLORIFICATION OF ARTISTS AND THEIR PERCEIVED INFALLIBLE BEHAVIOR THROUGH THE EYES OF FANS MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO BE ABUSIVE TOWARD THOSE WHO LOVE THEM UNCONDITIONALLY A CULTURE OF SILENCE LETS ABUSERS RUN FREE MARYSE BERNARD KNOWN AS MARYZE A YOUNG UPANDCOMING ARTIST FROM THE MONTRAL SCENE EXPLAINS HOW DISAPPOINTING THE ALLEGATIONS WERE WHEN SHE READ THE NEWS ITS DISHEARTENING ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO SAW ARCADE FIRE AS A VERY FUNLOVING POSITIVE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEN ITS LIKE OH EVEN THE GOOD ONES HERE HAVE STORIES THAT COME OUT SO YOU WONDER KIND OF LIKE WHO IN THE SCENE CAN YOU TRUST IN MONTRAL ARTISTS HELP AND MENTOR EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO EXPORT THEIR TALENTS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY MONTRAL WAS ALWAYS THIS KIND OF CULTURAL MECCA OF CANADA BERNARD SAYS I THINK THERE HAS BEEN THIS KIND OF MYTH OF MONTRAL ESPECIALLY IN THE HEYDAY OF ARCADE FIRE OF THAT SCENE THAT WAS VERY ARTSY AND FREE AND WELCOMING AND YOU KNOW OPEN TO ALL PEOPLE A CITY WHERE YOU COULD BE YOURSELF NO MATTER HOW FREAKY YOUR ART WAS IT WAS A PLACE TO EXPLORE CREATIVITY ITS JUST THIS WEIRD UNWRITTEN RULE THAT ABUSE IS JUST GONNA HAPPEN THAT YOULL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IF YOU WANT TO GET INMARYSE BERNARDTO MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE FOR THIS ARTICLE THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST WIN BUTLER CAME AS A SURPRISE THE BAND WAS KNOWN FOR TAKING A STAND ON SOCIAL ISSUES MOST NOTABLY BY SUPPORTING INITIATIVES IN HAITI RGINE CHASSAGNE THE BANDS LEAD SINGER AND BUTLERS WIFE COFOUNDED KANPE AN ORGANIZATION THAT BRINGS HELP TO UNDERSERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES IN HAITI THEY WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE MONTRAL COMMUNITY ADDS BERNARD THEY WERE THE KIND OF ARTISTS THAT YOU KNOW SMALLER ARTISTS WOULD HANG OUT WITH AND IN SOME WAYS THATS GREAT IF THEY COULD OFFER FORMS OF MENTORSHIP BECAUSE MANY YOUNG ARTISTS NEED HELP AND BE REASSURED THAT THEY DONT NEED TO JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS TO BE IN THIS INDUSTRY YOU CAN DO WHAT FEELS GOOD FOR YOU BUT ITS WHEN BIG ARTISTS LIKE ARCADE FIRE TAKE THAT RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR ADVANTAGE THAT THESE THINGS LIKE ABUSE ARE HAPPENING BERNARD SAYS A CULTURE OF SILENCE EXISTS IN THE CANADIAN SCENE WHERE ABUSED PEOPLE DECIDE TO STAY SILENT TO PRESERVE THEIR CAREERS AS IF THERE IS A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE THINGS WILL HAPPEN IN SOMEONES CAREER ITS JUST THIS WEIRD UNWRITTEN RULE THAT ABUSE IS JUST GONNA HAPPEN THAT YOULL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IF YOU WANT TO GET IN BERNARD SAYS YOURE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IT SOME PEOPLE WILL TREAT YOU BADLY ESPECIALLY IF YOURE STARTING OUT AND YOU DONT WANT TO ROCK THE BOAT BERNARD MENTIONS THAT ARTISTS HAVE BEEN TALKING MORE AND DENOUNCING SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE MUSIC SCENE MORE BUT THERES STILL A LEVEL OF FEAR THAT CAREERS WILL BE TARNISHED OR THAT THEY WONT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THIS SILENCE LETS ABUSERS ROAM FREE IN THE SCENE WITHOUT APPARENT CONSEQUENCES WE SEE THEM AT A PANEL OR A FESTIVAL AND THEYRE JUST LIKE HANGING AROUND IM LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THIS MAKING UNCOMFORTABLE HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS A BAD PERSON THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL AROUND AND THAT SHOULDNT REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY ANYMORE AND THEYRE STILL JUST HERE LIKE NOTHING  BERNARD NOTES COURAGEOUS AND RESILIENT BERNARD ISNT A STRANGER TO ALL OF THIS SHE HERSELF HAS SUFFERED ABUSE IN THE INDUSTRY BY SOMEONE SHES NOT YET WILLING TO NAME IM STILL AFRAID TO CALL OUT MY ABUSERS WITHIN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY YOU KNOW AND FOR WHAT I DO FEEL THAT IM IN A POSITION WHERE I WOULD BE BELIEVED AND THAT I WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BUT IM STILL SCARED OF THE REPERCUSSIONS I EVEN HEAR MYSELF YOU KNOW LIKE METERING MY WORDS AND CALCULATING SOME RESPONSES BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO LIKE I DONT WANT TO PUT MYSELF IN AN UNSAFE POSITION WITH ARCADE FIRE IT WAS LIKE QUESTIONING SOMETHING THAT WAS BIGGER THAN US WHEN THE PITCHFORK STORY WAS PUBLISHED ON SATURDAY AUG    COINCIDENTALLY AT THE START OF ELECTION SEASON IN QUBEC  CANADIAN MEDIA TOOK THE WEEKEND TO REPORT THE NEWS LA PRESSE A MAJOR QUBCOIS NEWS SOURCE RELEASED A SHORT REPORT ON THE ALLEGATIONS THAT EVENING AND THE CBC RAN A STORY THE NEXT DAY ON TV AFTER PITCHFORKS FOLLOWUP FEATURING A FIFTH ALLEGATION ONLY ONE MAJOR CANADIAN MEDIA OUTLET TVA AND JOURNAL DE MONTRAL THROUGH QMI PRESS AGENCY ALL THREE ENTITIES OWNED BY QUBCOR A MEDIA CONGLOMERATE FEATURED THE STORY IN FRENCH WITH SCANT COVERAGE ON THE ALLEGATIONS CONSEQUENCES WERE PRACTICALLY NONEXISTENT WHICH ONLY ADDS TO THE CULTURE OF SILENCE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WE SAW THE CBC FAIL TO HAVE AN ONLINEACCESSIBLE STORY ABOUT BUTLER UNTIL LIKE A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE INVESTIGATION BROKE EXPLAINS TORONTOBASED POP CULTURE CRITIC JILL KRAJEWSKI OUR NATIONAL BROADCASTER DIDNT RUN A TV STORY UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THE LA PRESSE STORY BROKE AT  PM ON A SATURDAY EVENING IN THE QUBEC MARKET MAKES IT NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERYONE FINALLY I DECIDED THAT ARCADE FIRE WASNT WORTHY OF MY ADMIRATION ANYMORELISE JETTQUBCOIS PEOPLE ARE PROTECTIVE OF THEIR UNIQUE CULTURAL EXPORTS LALANDE EXPLAINS HOW THIS CULTURAL PRIDE HAS AN IMPACT ON JOURNALISM MOSTLY ON REPORTING CULTURAL AFFAIRS A CULTURE JOURNALIST REPORTER OR COLUMNIST CANNOT BRING UP A PUBLIC FIGURES DARK SIDE IN JUST ANY CIRCUMSTANCE SAYS LALANDE FIRST MOST MEDIA WOULDNT EVEN CONSIDER THAT TO BE THEIR JOB SECOND FACTCHECKING TAKES A CERTAIN EDITORIAL STRUCTURE THAT I DONT THINK MOST OUTLETS HAVE ITS HARD NEWS IT IS THE JOB OF AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST NOT AN ARTS ONE IT IS NOT SEEN AS THEIR ROLE WHILE THIS STATEMENT BRINGS UP THE DIFFICULTY OF REPORTING ON ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IT ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WEIGHT THESE STORIES PULL IN MAJOR MEDIA BUT FOR LISE JETT THE REASON FOR THE LACK OF COVERAGE MIGHT HAVE STEMMED FROM SOMETHING ELSE  A SORT OF MOURNING PROCESS YES IT TOOK TIME FOR EVERYONE TO REACT JETT SAYS WE ALL NEEDED TO ABSORB THE SHOCKING NEWS AS MUCH FOR THE REAL FANS AS THE LOCAL MEDIA WE HAD TO TAKE A MINUTE SIT DOWN AND DIGEST IT TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON IT JETT REMEMBERS ANOTHER MOMENT IN QUBECS MUSIC HISTORY THE METOO ALLEGATIONS OF SUMMER  A PROMINENT QUBCOIS LABEL DARE TO CARE RECORDS WAS THROWN INTO DISARRAY AFTER SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ONE OF ITS ARTISTS BERNARD ADAMUS WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE HEAD OF THE LABEL ELI BISSONNETTE RESIGNED AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF PROTECTING ADAMUS FOR THE PAST  YEARS KNOWING THAT THE ARTIST HAD BEHAVED IN PROBLEMATIC WAYS TOWARD HIS FANS BUT THEY WERENT THE ONLY ONES MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE FROM THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WERE OUTED INCLUDING DAVID DESROSIERS WHO LEFT SIMPLE PLAN AS A RESULT WHILE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THESE ALLEGATIONS WAS SWIFT THOSE AGAINST BUTLER RAISED AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION WITH ARCADE FIRE IT WAS LIKE QUESTIONING SOMETHING THAT WAS BIGGER THAN US JETT WHO WRITES FOR SEVERAL MONTRALBASED OUTLETS SAYS IT WAS AS IF YOU WERE ASKING EVERYONE TO KILL THEIR DARLINGS WE STARTED QUESTIONING HOW DID THIS HAPPEN WHY DID WE NOT SEE ANYTHING IT MAKES ME QUESTION MY PROFESSIONAL ROOTS AND MY PERSONAL ATTACHMENT TO MUSIC WHEN NEWS BROKE THE YOUNG JOURNALIST TOOK A STEP BACK TO EVALUATE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THE STORY SHE MENTIONS ALWAYS BELIEVING VICTIMS WHETHER THEY SEEM TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT BELIEVING THEM AND OFFERING THEM SUPPORT RATHER THAN QUESTIONING THEM HER FEMINIST BELIEFS ARE GREATER THAN HER LOVE FOR ARCADE FIRE AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED THE MUSIC SHE CAME TO A PAINFUL REALIZATION FINALLY I DECIDED THAT ARCADE FIRE WASNT WORTHY OF MY ADMIRATION ANYMORE THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THE INDUSTRY IS THROUGH EDUCATION AND SAFE SPACES WHAT UPSET ME SO MUCH IS WHEN I READ THE ARTICLE I WAS LIKE OH WIN BUTLER USED THE POP VS JOCKS EVENT TO PREY ON THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS BARELY  OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THAT WAS KIND OF F UP DANIEL SELIGMANS VOICE IS THICK WITH ANGER AND DISAPPOINTMENT THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF POP MONTRAL A MASSIVE ANNUAL NOTFORPROFIT CULTURAL EVENT THAT SHOWCASES EMERGING AND INDEPENDENT TALENT FROM MONTRAL AND ACROSS THE WORLD FELT BETRAYED NOT ONLY WAS  THE LAST YEAR OF POP MONTRAL WORKING WITH ARCADE FIRE FOR POP VS JOCKS A FRIENDLY CHARITY BASKETBALL GAME BETWEEN INDIE ARTISTS FROM MAJOR BANDS BUT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE LEFT A BAD TASTE IN HIS MOUTH ACCORDING TO THE PITCHFORK INVESTIGATION STELLA A PSEUDONYM ONE OF BUTLERS ALLEGED VICTIMS WAS CONTACTED BY THE SINGER AFTER TAKING PICTURES AT THE EVENT BUTLER HAD A PATTERN SAYS SELIGMAN HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND THE FESTIVAL FOR ME THAT WAS S BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY FOR A LOCAL CHARITY THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE LAST TIME WE WORKED WITH THE BAND THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD WE WERE WORKING REALLY HARD AND WE KIND OF FELT SLIGHTLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HE WASNT VERY NICE TO WORK WITH HE WAS SLIGHTLY ABUSIVE AND THEN AFTER READING THAT ARTICLE I WAS TAKEN ABACK FOR SELIGMAN THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THE INDUSTRY IS THROUGH EDUCATION AND CREATING SAFE SPACES IN WHICH PEOPLE WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS I THINK ITS IMPORTANT JUST TO HAVE AN OUTWARD DISPLAY OF POLICIES THAT ARE SLIGHTLY SYMBOLIC IT SHOWS THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN YOUR EVENTS THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT KEEPS US SAFER I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOUR POLICIES UP ON YOUR WEBSITE MAKING SURE YOU ARE LISTENING TO PEOPLE FANS AND OTHER ARTISTS WHO HAVE ISSUES JILL KRAJEWSKI AND MARYSE BERNARD ALSO MENTION THAT WHISPER NETWORKS  THAT IS NETWORKS OF PEOPLE SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSERS  HAVE EMERGED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OLIVIER LALANDE REMEMBERS A MUCH DIFFERENT CLIMATE IN THE AUGHTS RUMORS OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR WERE COMMON BUT DIDNT RAISE EYEBROWS SOME ARTISTS WERE EVEN UPFRONT ABOUT IT WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THE ABUSE LALANDE SAYS I REMEMBER BEING AT PARTIES HEARING ARTISTS MAKING NASTY JOKES ABOUT THE GIRLS THEY SLEPT WITH ON TOUR WHILE THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE I KNEW  YOUD WANT TO QUESTION THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME HE IS AN ARTIST WE CANT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS GOING THROUGH I NOTICED THIS A LOT BUT FOR BERNARD ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE PITCHFORK ARTICLE THAT GOT HER ATTENTION WAS THE YOUNG AGE OF THE VICTIMS SOMETHING SHE CAN RELATE TO FROM HER OWN EXPERIENCE IN HER LATE TEENS AND EARLY S WITH OLDER PEOPLE IN THE CANADIAN SCENE A LOT OF THESE EXPERIENCES HAPPEN TO YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO HAVENT HAD ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCES SAYS BERNARD ITS NOT LIKE THEY DONT KNOW THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARENT OKAY BUT THEY HAVENT LEARNED YET SOME BEHAVIORS ARE ACTUALLY BAD AND NEED TO BE CALLED OUT IF PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU THIS IS JUST HOW IT IS YOURE MORE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEM WHEN YOURE YOUNGER ITS EASIER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUNGER BRIGHTEYED ARTISTS OR FANS BUT EVEN AS MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY WANT CHANGE AN INVISIBLE FORCE REMAINS STORIES OF ABUSE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY PROMPTED SARAH ARMIENTO TO START HOT TRAMP RECORDS A WOMENONLY LABEL IN RESPONSE TO THE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR SHE EXPERIENCED IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WHEN I WAS IN TORONTO I GOT UNSOLICITED PICTURES FROM MEN PEOPLE I WORKED WITH AND OTHER TYPES OF EXPERIENCES SAYS ARMIENTO THIS IS WHAT MADE ME WANT TO START A COMPANY LIKE HOT TRAMP WHEN I READ THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPENING IT MAKES ME REMEMBER WHY I STARTED MY LABEL ARMIENTO COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS WHY WOMEN WOULD WANT TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY WITH OTHER WOMEN IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WHO CAN UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER SHE TRIES TO MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE WITHIN HER LABEL AND THEIR WORK AND SHE ISNT THE ONLY ONE AFTER DARE TO CARES TURMOIL BATRICE MARTIN AKA CUR DE PIRATE ONE OF THE LABELS MAJOR SUCCESSES PURCHASED AND RENAMED THE LABEL BRAVO MUSIQUE VOWING TO CHANGE THINGS IN THE INDUSTRY IN AN INTERVIEW FOR EXCLAIMCA SHE SAID A LOT OF STUFF WAS SWEPT UNDER THE RUG OR NOBODY DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT I WANT PEOPLE TO COME TO ME AND SAY THIS IS HAPPENING AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ITS ABOUT RESPECT AND DECENCY OUR WORK EXTENDS EVERYWHERE IT EXTENDS TO HOW WE BEHAVE LIKE ARTISTS AND ELSEWHERE IT WASNT CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHERE WORK STARTED AND ENDED AND NOW ITS CLEARER SO THATS GOOD BOUNDARIES ARE IMPORTANT BUT EVEN AS MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND CHANGE IT SEEMS LIKE AN INVISIBLE FORCE KEEPS ON BRINGING CONTROVERSIES OF ITS OWN ARCADE FIRE CONTINUED ITS NORTH AMERICAN TOUR THOUGH FEIST AND BECK DROPPED OFF AS OPENERS ON SEPT    JUST THREE WEEKS AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BUTLER  MONTRAL ARTIST PIERRE KWENDERS ENDED HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH FOR THE POLARIS MUSIC PRIZE BY THANKING BUTLER AND ARCADE FIRE FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HIS ALBUM ALTHOUGH ONE RADIO HOST AT RADIOCANADA ASKED KWENDERS ABOUT THE SPEECH AND SOME OTHER ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY MENTIONED THE INCIDENT IN TWEETS THE MOMENT WENT PRACTICALLY UNNOTICED THAT ALREADY TELLS YOU THE PROBLEM WITH CANADAS MUSIC INDUSTRY HAVING A CULTURE OF SILENCE JILL KRAJEWSKI SAYS PEOPLE MADE A DELIBERATE CHOICE NOT TO CALL IT OUT  WHY DID PIERRE KWENDERS BRING UP SOMEONE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN A WIDESPREAD INVESTIGATION WERE THEY GENUINELY THANKFUL FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR ALBUM THATS ONE THING BUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT ARCADE FIRE AND WIN BUTLER HAS CHANGED AND IT WASNT APPROPRIATE TO BE PRAISING SOMEONE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CERTAINLY NOT ON THE PLATFORM OF POLARIS BEING STREAMED LIVE ON CBC MUSIC A PUBLICFUNDED MEDIA THAT WAS VERY DISTASTEFUL IF THIS HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AFTER THE ALLEGATIONS HOW CAN THE CANADIAN FANS EXPECT THE SCENE TO GO FORWARD AND CHANGE LISE JETT ADDS SHE WONDERS IF ARTISTS ARENT ABLE TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF OTHERS BECAUSE THEY FEEL PROTECTED BY THE INDUSTRY THEY ARENT AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR CAREER IM VIGILANT ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE INDUSTRY BUT THEY HAVE TO GET SCARED OF LOSING SOMETHING WE NEED TO SCARE THEM THEY NEED TO BE SCARED OF GETTING CAUGHT HOWEVER ACCLAIM HAS CONTINUED UNABATED WE ARCADE FIRES MOST RECENT ALBUM WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST ALTERNATIVE MUSIC ALBUM BY THE GRAMMYS THE BAND FINISHED THE NORTH AMERICAN LEG OF ITS TOUR IN MONTRAL TO A SOLDOUT CROWD ON JAN  THE JUNO AWARDS PRESENTED BY THE CANADIAN ACADEMY OF RECORDING ARTS AND SCIENCES ANNOUNCED ARCADE FIRES NOMINATION FOR GROUP OF THE YEAR WHEN THE CBC ASKED FOR COMMENT ABOUT THE NOMINATION CARAS RESPONDED WE LOOK AT ARCADE FIRES NOMINATION FOR GROUP OF THE YEAR AS ONE FOR THE ENTIRE BAND WHILE WE TAKE THE ALLEGATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY IN THIS SITUATION WE ARE ALSO HONORING THE REST OF THE BAND FOR THEIR SUCCESS WE HOPE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BUTLER WILL NOT DETRACT FROM THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE OTHER GROUP MEMBERS AS AWARDS MOUNT AND REPERCUSSIONS DO NOT MONTRAL AND THE CANADIAN MUSIC SCENE AT LARGE ARE LEFT WITH ONE QUESTION WITHOUT ANY REAL CONSEQUENCES WILL THESE SITUATIONS KEEP RECURRING

HEARD THE RUMBLINGS ABOUT THAT WASNT TRUE AND MYSELF AND BEN DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT SO I WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE  I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT A LOT OF IT MAN TO BE HONEST

IT TAKES AWAY FROM IT A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOWSOUNDBITE OF MUSICBOWMAN SO ITS BEEN MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE THE MARINES PROMISED LAWMAKERS THAT GENERAL MATTIS WOULD REDOUBLE EFFORTS TO CONTACT THESE WOUNDED MEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED I MEAN IF WE COULD FIND THESE GUYS HOW IS IT THAT MATTIS CANT WHY HAVE MEN LIKE EVERETT WATT AND JOHN SMITH BEEN LEFT TO WONDER FOR SO LONGSOUNDBITE OF MUSICG SMITH NOT EVERYONE HAD TO WONDER FOR ALL OF THOSE YEARS SOME OF THEM HAD A DIFFERENT BURDEN  THE TRUTH  BECAUSE A COUPLE OF THE MARINES IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE DID KNOW ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ONE OF THEM WAS THE RADIO OPERATOR AND BECAUSE HE KNEW CHRIS COVINGTON WAS ROB ZURHEIDES BEST FRIEND THIS RADIO OPERATOR TOLD CHRIS WHAT HED LEARNED LISTENING TO THE RADIO TRAFFIC WITH OTHER UNITS  THAT IT WAS A FRIENDLY ROUND AND COVINGTON HE ENDED UP TELLING ROBS WIDOWCOVINGTON I GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO ELENA AND HER MOM OFF AND ON FROM THE INTERNET CENTER AND I DIDNT KNOW THAT THEY HAD LIED TO THEM AND SHE WOULD  AND IT CAME UP BECAUSE SHE KEPT ASKING YOU KNOW WHY WAS IT A CLOSED CASKET AS FAR AS SHE KNEW HE HAD BEEN SHOT AND I DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAS ASKING THAT AND WHEN I REALIZED THEY LIED TO HER I TOLD HER THE TRUTH AND THEN I GOT IN A S TON OF TROUBLE AFTER THATG SMITH WHAT KIND OF TROUBLECOVINGTON THEY DIDNT REALLY CARE THEY WERE JUST  THEY WERE ANGRYG SMITH NO NO YOU MEAN THE MARINES WERE ANGRY THAT YOU HAD TOLD THEM WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENEDCOVINGTON THE COMMAND WAS BECAUSE I WENT TO THEMBOWMAN BUT IF THIS WAS TRUE HOW HAD IT HAPPENED WHO SCREWED UP BEN LIOTTA WAS A NAVY CORPSMAN BUT HE WAS TAPPED INTO WHAT THE MARINES CALL THE LCU  THE LANCE CORPORAL UNDERGROUNDLIOTTA NOW HERES ONLY WHAT IVE BEEN TOLD I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS FACTUAL AT ALL  IS LIEUTENANT MCCOY  I GUESS THE GUY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL THESE IN  HE CALLED IT IN AND HE REVERSED THE COORDINATES  THAT HE GAVE OUR GRID AS THE TARGET GRID AND THE TARGET GRID AS OUR GRID SO THEY HIT DEAD ON THEY HIT WHAT THEY WERE TOLD TO HIT I CANT PROVE THAT THAT IS LITERALLY JUST WHAT IVE BEEN TOLD DOWN THE PIPELINEBOWMAN THIS LIEUTENANT MCCOY HIS NAME CAME UP A LOT WE LEARNED HE WAS NOT IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE BUT WAS NEARBY IN ANOTHER BUILDING IT WAS PART OF HIS JOB TO REQUEST SUPPORT FROM HELICOPTERS OR GUNSHIPS OR MORTAR MISSIONS TO HELP MARINES UNDER ATTACK NAVY CORPSMAN JASON DUTY TOLD US THAT AFTER THE EXPLOSION MCCOY WAS A WRECKDUTY I REMEMBER BECAUSE HE WAS PALE AND HE LOOKED SHAKEN AND I DONT THINK HED SLEPT YEAH IT WAS THE NEXT DAY AND HE SAID DOC I THINK I F UP AND I SAID HOW HE GOES I JUST THINK I F UP I THINK I F UP AND I WAS LIKE WELL WHAT DID YOU F UP AND HE SAID WELL I CANT REALLY TALK ABOUT IT BUT I THINK I F UP I THINK I F UP AND I THINK THAT WAS HONESTLY THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HIMBOWMAN WEVE SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO FIND MCCOY ONE GUY TOLD US MCCOY GOT KICKED OUT OF THE MARINES TURNS OUT THATS NOT TRUE HED BEEN PROMOTED  LEFT AS A MAJOR WE FIGURED OUT HE STILL WORKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS A CIVILIAN WE CALLED HIS NUMBER EMAILED EVEN HAD A LETTER HANDCARRIED TO WHERE HE WORKS WE NEVER HEARD BACK SO WHETHER ITS LIEUTENANT MCCOY OR SOMEONE ELSE AT THIS POINT IN OUR INVESTIGATION ITS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK WITH SOME OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE INVOLVED GUYS LIKE SMITH WATT LIOTTA  THEY CAN TELL US ABOUT WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE BUT NOT WHY AND HOW THE WHOLE THING HAPPENED ITS THE OFFICERS WHO DECIDE WHETHER TO FIRE A MORTAR WHAT ABOUT THE OFFICER WHO WAS IN COMMAND AT THE SCHOOLHOUSESOUNDBITE OF MUSICG SMITH THIS IS TAKING COVER FROM NPROK EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE OPERATING SO THANKS AGAIN FOR COMING OUT AND IF YOU COULD JUST FIRST OFF TELL ME YOUR NAME AND JUST  I KNOW YOURE A LIEUTENANT COLONEL NOW BUT YOU WERE AT THE TIME  WHAT  SECOND LIEUTENANTBEN WAGNER YEAH I WAS BEN WAGNER IS MY NAME NOW IT IS MY NAME AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN I AM A LIEUTENANT COLONEL NOWG SMITH TWO STEPS BELOW A GENERAL WAGNER WAS STATIONED IN OKINAWA BUT WE GOT TOGETHER WHEN HE VISITED NORFOLK VA THATS HOME TO THE BIGGEST NAVAL BASE IN THE WORLD AFTER DINNER WE SAT DOWN AT A SMALL PARK NEAR THE WATER LOOKING UP AT TWO MASSIVE WARSHIPS HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN FALLUJAH THE EARLY PATROL WHERE HED BEEN WOUNDED YOU HEARD THAT EARLIER AND THEN I ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS LIKE AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE WAITING OUT THE CEASEFIRESO I DO WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE  OF APRIL CAN YOU TELL ME JUST ABOUT THAT DAYWAGNER IN THAT SCHOOLHOUSE  YOU KNOW IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING THAT WAS TWO STORIES HIGH WITH AN OPEN COURTYARD IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN ON THE SECOND FLOOR THERE WAS A KIND OF A BALCONY CATWALK KIND OF OPEN HALLWAY THAT RAN AROUND THREE SIDES OF THE COURTYARD THAT DAY WE HAD DONE OUR KIND OF DAILY ROUTINE AND WHATNOT AND THEN WE WENT TO STANDTO ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE SUN WAS SUPPOSED TO SET AND WE HAD BEEN TAKING POP SHOTS FROM THE SOUTH THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND THEN THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT LIVELIER RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT WE WENT TO STANDTO AND THEN THATS WHEN THE  MM MORTAR MISSION WAS CALLED ING SMITH DID YOU CALL THAT INWAGNER NO I DID NOT CALL THAT ING SMITH SO YOU  SO YOURE BASICALLY DOING STANDTO AND TAKING SOME RELATIVELY LIGHT CONTACT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BOOM IS ESSENTIALLY  LIKE YOU DIDNT KNOW A MORTAR MISSION HAD BEEN CALLEDWAGNER NO I DID I KNEW A MORTAR MISSION HAD BEEN CALLED I HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT A MORTAR MISSION HAD BEEN CALLED AND SO I WAS RUNNING KIND OF SHUFFLING ALONG THAT EXPOSED HALLWAY ON THE SECOND FLOORG SMITH SO HE HEARS ON THE RADIO THAT A MORTAR ROUND IS COMING IN AND HE HEADS TO A ROOM THAT OVERLOOKS THE STREET WAGNER WANTS TO SEE THE ROUND DESTROY THAT BURNING TIRE BARRICADE INSTEAD HE HEARS A MASSIVE BLAST BEHIND HIM DOWN IN THE COURTYARDDID YOU KNOW THE MINUTE THAT IT HIT THAT IT HAD BEEN THAT MORTAR MISSION THAT HAD BEEN CALLED IN VERSUS AN IRAQI ROUNDWAGNER I DONT THINK I MADE THE CONNECTION IMMEDIATELY BUT IT WAS NOT  IT DIDNT TAKE ME LONG TO FIGURE THAT OUT YEAH I DIDNT SAY IT TO THE GUYS BUT YEAH I DIDG SMITH BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS A DAY THAT YOU DIDNT REALLY GRAPPLE WITH I THINK FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT IT TOOK YOU A WHILE TO SORT OF LET YOURSELF GO BACK AND PROCESS ITWAGNER YEAHG SMITH A LITTLE BITWAGNER YEAHG SMITH IS THAT FAIRWAGNER ITS  NO ITS CERTAINLY A TRUE STATEMENT YOU KNOW I ABSOLUTELY LEARNED THE LESSONS  A LOT OF LESSONS THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT DAY AND APPLIED THEM TO FOLLOWON SITUATIONS THAT I FOUND MYSELF IN AND YOU KNOW THE DAY KEPT  IT CAME UP ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW I STAYED IN TOUCH WITH BRAD SHUDERS PARENTS AND SOME OF THE GUYS AND WHEN I WAS STATIONED THERE IN QUANTICO I WOULD GO AND I VISITED BRAD HES BURIED THERE AT ARLINGTON BUT FROM AN EMOTIONAL STANDPOINT YEAH I DID NOT  I DIDNT REALLY DIVE INTO IT I DIDNT NECESSARILY HAVE THE EMOTIONAL SPACE AND TIME TO DO THAT AND I ALSO ACTIVELY DIDNT GIVE MYSELF THAT SPACE AND TIME TO DO THATNOW OLDER AS A DAD ITS THE PERSONAL SORROW THAT REMAINS WITH ME THERES A SENSE THAT YOURE STILL PAYING OFF THE PRICE YOU KNOW FOR THOSE GUYS AND AGAIN YOU COULD PROBABLY PSYCHOANALYZE THAT ALL DAY LONG AND TELL ME THAT ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OR ITS NOT REAL OR IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE OR ITS IRRATIONAL OR ILLOGICAL OR WHATEVER THATS  ALL THAT IS FINE AND IM SURE IT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT ITS NOT REAL LIKE THE REALITY IS I FEEL GUILTY SO YEAHG SMITH HE SAYS PART OF THE GUILT PART OF HIS WHATIFS IS JUST BECAUSE HE WAS IN CHARGE AT THE SCHOOL HE WAS THE ONE WHO PUT BRAD SHUDER ON POST BY THE PICNIC TABLE COULD HE HAVE MADE SURE THAT THE MARINES GOT TO THEIR POSITIONS MORE QUICKLY ALSO HE TOLD ME HE DISCIPLINED ROB ZURHEIDE FOR SOME MINOR INFRACTION THAT WEEK WAGNER SAID HE FELT BAD AND MADE AMENDS BY BUYING ROB SOME OF HIS FAVORITE CIGARETTES KOOL MENTHOLS HE ASKED ME TO GUESS WHAT ROB WAS DOING WHEN THE MORTAR HIT HE WAS IN THE COURTYARD SMOKING ONE OF THOSE KOOLS WAGNER GAVE HIMBOWMAN ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION WAGNER SAID THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT HE WAS AT A MARINE BASE OUTSIDE DC AND SOME COLONEL CAME BY WITH A COPY OF THE REPORT  HAD HIM READ IT OVER ITS NOT REALLY CLEAR WHY IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO BUT WAGNER REMEMBERS IT POINTED TO A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS  BOTH IN HOW THE MISSION WAS CALLED IN AND HOW IT WAS HANDLED BY OFFICERS INSIDE THE OPERATION CENTER THATS WHERE THEY LOOK AT MAPS PLOT OUT COORDINATES TO MAKE SURE A MORTAR ROUND IN WHAT THEY CALL A FIRE MISSION WONT HIT A FRIENDLY UNITWAGNER THERE IS ONE WAY THAT YOU YOU KNOW PROCESS AND CLEAR FIRES MISSIONS AND ITS THE WAY WEVE DONE IT FOR A LONG TIME AND THE REASON WEVE DONE IT THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME IS CAUSE IT WORKS WHEN ITS DONE PROPERLY YOU KNOW FIRES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CUT CORNERS ON FIRES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU RUSH FIRES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU ASSUME AND THAT IS JUST BECAUSE WHEN YOU START SLINGING ROUNDS AROUND ESPECIALLY IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT THE SITUATION IS WRIT LARGE ITS JUST FRAUGHT WITH RISKG SMITH SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU  HAVING SEEN THE INVESTIGATION AND WHATNOT  YOU HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE IT BROKE DOWNWAGNER YEAH I THINK I DO I THINK I DOG SMITH I MEAN PART OF WHATS CONFUSING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS THAT IT WAS HANDLED VERY STRANGELY ON THE BACK END OF THINGS LIKE TO THE POINT WHERE I BELIEVE YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO TELL THE FAMILIES  WELL NOT ENTIRELY TRUE LIKE CAUSE I  CHRIS WAS TELLING ME THAT HE GOT HIS ASS BUSTED FOR LIKE COMMUNICATING WITH ELENA YOU KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN A FRIENDLY FIRE THING BUT IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME FOR THE MARINES TOWAGNER YEAH AND ILL BE  I CANT SPEAK TOG SMITH AND I DONT WANT TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR LANE AND I KNOW YOUREWAGNER WELL I JUST  I MEAN I JUST  I CANT  THAT WAS YOU KNOW ONE TWO THREE FOUR LEVELS ABOVE ME I MEAN IT WAS A DIVISIONLEVEL INVESTIGATION THAT WAS ADJUDICATED BY GENERAL MATTIS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT  FOUR LEVELS OF COMMAND BETWEEN ME AND HIM AS THE PLATOON COMMANDERG SMITH BUT DID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU VISITED THEM THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE BREAKING THEM THIS NEWS ORWAGNER I WAS PREPARED FOR IT BECAUSE I HAD MADE THE DECISION THAT IF THEY WERE ASKING ME I WAS GOING TO TELL THEM I WASNT GOING TO LIE I DIDNT GIVE THEM ANY DETAILS BUT WHEN THEY ASKED IF IT WAS A FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT I SAID YES BECAUSE IF I LIED OR I WITHHELD THAT INFORMATION AND THEY FOUND OUT LATER THAT I KNEW IT AND I DIDNT ANSWER THEM THAT WOULD BREAK DOWN WHATEVER TRUST EXISTED  WHATEVER REMAINING TRUST EXISTED BETWEEN ME AND THEM THAT WOULD GO AWAY AND I WASNT WILLING TO SACRIFICE THATG SMITH THIS WAS NOT AN OFFICIAL MARINE CORPS VISIT WAGNER FELT A PERSONAL OBLIGATION TO THE MARINES HED LOST TO LOOK THEIR PARENTS IN THE EYE TO BE THERE FOR HIM ANYHOW BEFORE WE PARTED THERE WAS ONE MORE ASPECT OF THE ORIGINAL TIP I NEEDED TO CHECK ON TOMS SOURCE HAD SAID THERE WAS A CONGRESSMANS SON WORKING IN THE COMMAND CENTER THAT DAY IN FALLUJAH WAS THAT TRUE NO WAGNER SAID HE DIDNT THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS WRONGSOUNDBITE OF MUSICBOWMAN NEXT TIME ON TAKING COVER WEVE TALKED TO SO MANY OF THESE MEN ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES

DETAILS BUT THE SOURCE TOLD TOM AT LEAST ONE MARINE WAS KILLED AND HE SAID THE WHOLE THING WAS BURIED BECAUSE SOMEONE INVOLVED WAS THE SON OF A PROMINENT POLITICIAN TOM TEAMED UP WITH GRAHAM SMITH  A COLLEAGUE ON NPRS INVESTIGATIONS UNIT WHO LIKE TOM HAD SPENT YEARS COVERING THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN FOR MONTHS THEY TRIED TO CONFIRM THE TIP BY SCOURING WEBSITES AND MESSAGE BOARDS SIFTING THROUGH OLD NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS AND PRESS RELEASES FROM THE PENTAGON EVEN THE MARINE CORPS ITSELF SAID IT DIDNT HAVE ANY RECORDS OF SUCH AN INCIDENT BUT FINALLY THEY MADE A BREAKTHROUGH THANKS TO THE

IRAQ WAR IF YOU LIVED THROUGH IT COVERED IT MAYBE FOUGHT THERE IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY BUT THIS WAS  YEARS AGO NOW AND WE KNOW FOR SOME FOLKS THIS IS ANCIENT HISTORY MAYBE YOU WERE  WHEN IT KICKED OFF  SO VERY BASICS THE US INVADED AT THE BEGINNING OF  AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS DEFEATED THE IRAQI ARMY THOUGH THEY NEVER FOUND ANY OF THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT WERE THE WHOLE REASON FOR GOING IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL MAYBE NUCLEAR  THEY FOUND NOTHING STILL THE AMERICANS OCCUPIED THE COUNTRY THEY WERE RUNNING THINGS THEY FIGURED THEYD WON WHAT THEY DIDNT REALIZE  A NEW WAR WAS JUST BEGINNING BECAUSE A LOT OF IRAQIS HATED THE AMERICAN OCCUPIERS THEY FELT HUMILIATED BRUTALIZED AND THIS CITY OF FALLUJAH  ITS WHERE THE WHOLE NATURE OF THE WAR STARTED TO CHANGE IT BECAME THE CENTER OF AN INSURGENCY THAT AMERICA WOULD FIGHT TO THIS DAY REALLYBOWMAN SO WAS THERE A FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT THERE THERE WAS A MAJOR BATTLE THERE IN  IN THE SPRING  DIDNT LAST LONG JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN APRIL AND THESE DAYS THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD ONLINE LISTS OF CASUALTIES SO WE DID WHAT ANYBODY WOULD DO  A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH IT WAS A DEADLY MONTH BOTH FOR IRAQIS AND FOR THE US NEARLY  AMERICAN TROOPS WERE KILLED  OF THEM IN FALLUJAH THAT NARROWED THINGS DOWN A BIT BUT STILL NONE WERE LISTED AS FRIENDLY FIRE NOTHING SEEMED TO FIT FOR WEEKS WE PORED THROUGH SMALLTOWN NEWSPAPER OBITUARIES AND PRESS RELEASES THE PENTAGON SENDS OUT WHENEVER A SERVICE MEMBER IS KILLED FINALLY WE GOT A BREAKSOUNDBITE OF MUSICG SMITH IT WAS ON ONE OF THOSE MEMORIAL WEB PAGES LIKE THE ONES FUNERAL HOMES SET UP FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO LEAVE CONDOLENCES ONLY THIS SITE IS FOR FALLEN MARINES AND THE ENTRIES FOR TWO DIFFERENT MARINES KILLED ON THE SAME DAY  ROBERT ZURHEIDE AND BRAD SHUDER  ACTUALLY TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY FROM THE MILITARY PRESS RELEASES EACH OF THE TWO PAGES SAID THE MARINE WAS KILLED BY FRIENDLY FIRE RATHER THAN HOSTILE LIKE THE MILITARY REPORTED AND THEY WERE BOTH FROM THE SAME UNIT ECHO COMPANY SECOND BATTALION FIRST MARINE DIVISION  OR AS THE MARINES WOULD SAY ECHO  AND ANOTHER THING CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION  A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE NAMED CORPORAL GOMEZPEREZ HE WROTE APRIL  IS ALWAYS ON MY MIND AND EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT I JUST GET MAD MAN ITS BULLS WHAT HAPPENEDBOWMAN NOW THE INITIAL TIP WAS ONE DEAD ONE WOUNDED BUT HERE WE HAVE TWO MARINES FROM THE SAME UNIT WHO DIED ON THE SAME DAY WAS THIS THE FRIENDLY FIRE WE FILED A RECORDS REQUEST WITH THE MARINES LOOKING FOR ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INCIDENT WAS THERE AN INVESTIGATION NOW THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET WEIRD IT USUALLY TAKES MONTHS TO GET AN ANSWER FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT HERE AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE GOT A RESPONSE A THOROUGH SEARCH WAS MADE THE LETTER SAID NO RECORDS ON FILENO RECORDS IT MADE NO SENSE LOOK THE MILITARY INVESTIGATES AND DOCUMENTS EVERYTHING WHETHER ITS A MAJOR SCREWUP OR JUST SOMEONE LOSING A PIECE OF GEAR TWO MARINES KILLED EVEN IF IT WASNT FRIENDLY FIRE THERE SHOULD BE SOME RECORD OF THE DAY WE FILED AN APPEAL ASKING THEM TO LOOK AGAIN IT WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS I STARTED ASKING AROUND AT THE PENTAGON CALLING UP BOTH ACTIVE DUTY AND RETIRED OFFICERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO SERVED IN IRAQ HAVE YOU GUYS EVER HEARD ABOUT THIS WHO WAS INVOLVED WELL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT LATERG SMITH WITH TOM WORKING THE BRASS I WENT LOOKING FOR GRUNTS  THE GUYS WHO SERVED IN ECHO COMPANY I DUG THROUGH BOOKS ABOUT THE FIGHT IN FALLUJAH INCLUDING ONE CALLED NO TRUE GLORY I KNEW THE UNIT ECHO  AND THE NAMES OF THE MARINES WHO DIED PLUS A DATE  APRIL  BUT ACROSS  PAGES THERE IS NO MENTION OF A FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT THAT DAY OR ANY OTHER IN FACT NO MENTION OF APRIL  AT ALL IT WAS AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THAT DAY IN FALLUJAHBUT I DID FIND ONE CLUE  THAT CORPORAL GOMEZPEREZ FROM THE MEMORIAL WEB PAGE THERES A PICTURE OF HIM IN THE CENTER OF THIS BOOK STARING INTO THE CAMERA HALF HIS SHOULDER TORN AWAY BY A BULLET THE BOOK SAYS HE WAS WITH ECHO  BETWEEN THAT AND THE COMMENT  APRIL  IS ALWAYS ON MY MIND AND EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT I JUST GET MAD  I FIGURED THAT CORPORAL CARLOS GOMEZPEREZ MUST HAVE BEEN WITH

PROCEDUREMADDEN AND NEEDING MULTIPLE PROCEDURES CAN ALSO INCREASE THE RISK ACCORDING TO THE AESTHETIC SURGERY EDUCATION AND RESEARCH FOUNDATION BBLS HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE OF ANY COSMETIC

EVEN THOUGH ITS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR ME I WAS JUST SCARED THAT I WOULD HURT PEOPLES FEELINGS OR I WOULD OFFEND BLACK WOMEN AND THEY WOULDNT GET IT CAUSE THEY MISUNDERSTOOD ME BUT IT TURNED OUT BEING THE OPPOSITE AND THEY ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY FUCKED WITH IT AND A LOT OF BLACK WOMEN ACTUALLY SAID THEY NEEDED TO SEE IT A LOT OF BLACK GIRLS SAID THAT THEY JUST LOVED TO SEE A DARKSKINNED BLACK GIRL IN A NONSEXUALIZED WAY AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS DOPECARMICHAEL BUT THATS IF THEY EVEN GOT TO SEE ITMADDEN THIS WAS DEADASS SUPPOSED TO BE DOECHIIS INDUSTRY COMINGOUT PARTY INSTEAD THE CRAZY VIDEO DIDNT POP OFF LIKE IT SHOULD HAVECARMICHAEL AND BECAUSE OF YOUTUBES COMMUNITY GUIDELINES IT NEVER HIT THE HOME PAGE IT DIDNT TREND AND WITHOUT THAT VISIBILITY IT DEFINITELY DIDNT START THE DIALOGUE DOECHII HAD HOPED FORMADDEN SO HOW DOES THE SHADOW BAN WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE WAY THAT BLACK WOMENS BODIES ARE STILL BEING POLICED EVEN IN A TIME WHEN THERES SO MUCH VISIBILITY FOR WOMEN IN HIPHOPDOECHII THE SAME THING THAT I FEEL LIKE CRAZY WAS HELD BACK FOR IVE SEEN WORSE I JUST HAVE SEEN WORSE ON YOUTUBE AND NOT EVEN WORSE SAYING THAT CRAZY WAS BAD CAUSE ITS NOT ITS JUST IVE SEEN REALLY OUTOFPOCKET THINGS TREND AND GO CRAZY ON YOUTUBE AND I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND  I STILL HAVE TROUBLE DIGESTING AND PROCESSING LIKE WHY THAT HAPPENED WITH MY VIDEO YOU KNOW AND ID LIKE A SPECIFIC ANSWER BUT IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT AND IM LIKE MAYBE ITS CAUSE IM A SMALL ARTIST MAYBE ITS CAUSE  I TRIED TO TELL MYSELF ITS SO MANY OTHER THINGS I DONT WANT TO FEEL LIKE ITS BECAUSE IM A BLACK WOMAN YOU KNOW I DONT KNOW IM STILL UNPACKING THAT BUT IT DOES HURT MY FEELINGSMADDEN THIS HYPOCRISY DOECHIIS TALKING ABOUT IT REALLY AINT THAT HARD TO SEE YOU JUST GOT TO LOOK PAST THE VEIL OF THE MALE GAZE CHILDISH GAMBINOS THIS IS AMERICA CARDI BS PRESS OR LIL NAS XS INDUSTRY BABY  THERES A LOT OF NUDITY AND VIOLENCE ON YOUTUBE ON THE DAILY EVEN ON VIDEOS WITH STRONG POLITICAL OR SOCIAL MESSAGES LIKE THE ONE DOECHII WAS TRYING TO MAKE AND THAT DONT EVEN COUNT THE AMOUNT OF VIDEOS FULL OF RAPPERS JUST USING VIXENS AS PROPSCARMICHAEL BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK IT FEELS LIKE THERES A COMMON THREAD COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE ENFORCED DIFFERENTLY IF YOURE A HIGHPROFILE MAN OR TRYING TO GET THE ATTENTION OF MEN IF YOURE NOT APPEALING TO THE MALE GAZE YOURE NOT REWARDED ON THE PLATFORM AND IN THE AGE OF STREAMING AND ALGORITHMS BEING SEEN ON THIS PLATFORM IT DETERMINES A LOT FOR YOUR CAREER THIS IS HOW INSTITUTIONS ARE ABLE TO REINFORCE THAT BLACK FEMME BODIES ARE AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE SEEN AS INHERENTLY SEXUALMADDEN THERES SO MUCH CENSORSHIP WITH THIS VIDEO AND POLICING BLACK BODIES BLACK WOMENS BODIES HOW DOES THAT AFFECT WHAT YOU DO CREATIVELY AND WHAT  THE TYPES OF THEMES YOU SPEARHEAD AND YOU PUSH IN YOUR MUSICDOECHII I GUESS LIKE IT DOESNT AFFECT MY CREATIVITY IM STILL GOING TO KEEP PUSHING THESE MESSAGES IM STILL GOING TO KEEP CHALLENGING THESE SYSTEMS AND CHALLENGING THESE IDEALS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IM GOING TO KEEP GIVING THEM THAT PUSHBACK BUT I MEAN IT DOES AFFECT ME BECAUSE LOOK LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CENSORSHIP NOW LESS PEOPLE CAN SEE IT BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THESE RULES AND THINGS THAT ARE IN PLACE SO ITS NOT GOING TO AFFECT MY CREATIVITY BUT IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE MY ARTMADDEN DOES ANY PART OF IT IGNITE YOU TO PUSH EVEN FURTHER WITH THE MESSAGES IN YOUR ARTDOECHII ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BECAUSE ITS LIKE  I DONT KNOW I FEEL LIKE IM KIND OF FIGHTING IN A WAR AND LIKE I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE A PURPOSE TO CONTINUOUSLY KEEP DOING THAT AND THIS GOES BACK TO THE POINT OF WHY IM MAKING THE TYPE OF MUSIC I MAKE AND WHY I PUT OUT THESE TYPE OF VISUALS IS BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE TO A POINT WHERE BLACK WOMEN SPECIFICALLY CAN BE LIMITLESSLY CREATIVE AND WE DONT HAVE TO BE POLICED YOU KNOWCARMICHAEL I WANT THAT FOR DOECHII I WANT THAT FOR DREAMDOLL AND TATE TOO HELL I WANT THAT FOR EVERYBODY LIVING UNDER THE MALE GAZE EVEN THOUGH ITS UNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE MORE WOMEN IN RAP RIGHT NOW FINDING THEIR VOICE AND TAKING UP SPACE THE STRUCTURES THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB AND BE AS LIMITLESS AND CREATIVE AS THEY WANT TO BE ARE STILL AS RIGID AS EVER WEVE TALKED TO DOZENS OF RAPPERS WHILE MAKING THIS SEASON WHATS BECOME CLEAR IS THEY WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO MAKE THEIR ART ON THEIR TERMS WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKEMADDEN RIGHT YOUR BODY IS FOR NOBODY BUT YOU SO HOW CAN YOU RECLAIM THE GAZE OR LIVE YOUR LIFE IGNORING ITS PRESENCE AND HOW DOES THAT SQUARE WITH HOW SEX SELLS ESPECIALLY IN HIPHOP ONE WAY IS CELEBRATING YOUR BODY AND HAVING FULL CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU DO WITH IT BUT THATS A FIGHT THAT GOES BACK FOREVER IN HIPHOPCARMICHAEL AND YOU KNOW WHAT

I SAY CAUSE IM ON IM BAD WHEN IM TALKING TO YOUAND THE MANAGER LOVED ME YOU KNOW HE WAS LIKE YO YOU SPIT FIRECARMICHAEL THE CREW LIKED HOW SHE ROCKED AROUND SO MUCH THEY NAMED HER SHAROCK RIGHT ON THE

RAPSSHAROCK I WAS ALWAYS THEY SECRET WEAPON A LOT OF OTHER GROUPS WERE SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIND FEMALE MCS THAT CAN BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SHAROCKRAHIEM THERE WAS REALLY NO COMPETITION DURING THAT TIME ESPECIALLY FOR SHAROCKCARMICHAEL THATS RAHIEM ANOTHER ORIGINAL MEMBER OF THE FUNKY  RAHIEM AUDITIONED FOR THE GROUP AFTER SHA HAD ALREADY JOINED AND WITH RAHIEM JOINING THE CREW THE FUNKY  WERE LOCKED IN IT WAS KK ROCKWELL KEITH KEITH RAHIEM AND MC SHAROCK RAHIEM SAYS HE ALWAYS LOOKED AT SHAROCK LIKE A SISTER AND FROM DAY  HE RESPECTED HER TECHNIQUERAHIEM HER STYLE HER POISE HER DELIVERY YOU KNEW

YEAH BUT PEEP THIS  HE ALSO SAYS SHE SERVED A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE TO THE GROUPRAHIEM WITH A FEMALE IN THE GROUP YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THATS TO CALM THE WOLVES DOWN AND WE NEEDED THAT DURING THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE IF WE DIDNT KEEP THE AUDIENCES THAT WE ENTERTAINED IN THE IN THE BRONX DURING THE S THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SHOOTOUT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A STABBING

AND YOU KNOW THIS IS ALSO BEFORE EMAIL WAS SO EASILY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE SO WE WERE GETTING LETTERS THAT WERE DEATH THREATS SO IT WAS A VERY CHALLENGING TIME AND IT WAS  THAT LEVEL OF VITRIOL DIRECTED AT US AS YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS JUST BECAUSE WE DARED TO ASK QUESTIONS FELT REALLY TELLINGMADDEN FROM YOUS A HO PH TO TIP DRILL SHE KEPT FEELING A HATRED COMING FROM SOMETHING SHE LOVED BUT SHE DIDNT HAVE THE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE IT THE TERM SHE FINALLY LANDED ON WAS MISOGYNOIR A MASHUP OF MISOGYNY AND NOIR THE FRENCH WORD FOR BLACK AND A NOD TO FILM NOIRCARMICHAEL MOYA COINED THE WORD ALMOST  YEARS AGO   YEARS BEFORE THE TORY LANEZ TRIALBAILEY I SO APPRECIATE YOU SAYING TORY LANEZ TRIAL CAUSE SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE HAVE TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID MEGS TRIAL AND THAT SHIFT IS SUBTLE BUT TO ME THATS A MANIFESTATION OF MISOGYNOIR THIS IS  PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER MEGAN IS TELLING THE TRUTH AND THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS IN FACT BEING HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER  THAT IS A MANIFESTATION OF MISOGYNOIRCARMICHAEL WERE YOU SHOCKED TO SEE THE WAY IT WAS SPINNING OUT IN TERMS OF THE MISOGYNOIR MANIFESTING IN THE WAY THAT IT DID OR WAS IT JUST LIKE YEAH I PREDICTED THIS  I SAW THIS COMINGBAILEY I HAVE TO SAY I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BECAUSE MEG IS A RAPPER FIRST YOU KNOW LIKE YOU CANNOT DENY HER SKILL AND NORMALLY THERES AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU KNOW SKILL IS WHAT MATTERS SKILL IS THE THING BUT ITS VERY CLEAR THAT SKILL IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN THESE NARRATIVES ARE PART OF HOW BLACK WOMEN ARE VIEWED GENERALLYMADDEN THIS TRIAL EXPOSED CRACKS IN THE CULTURE THAT ACTUALLY GO BEYOND HIPHOPBAILEY THERE ARE THESE TENSIONS THAT ARE RUNNING DEEP AND HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH NARRATIVES THAT WEVE INTERNALIZED ABOUT HOW BLACK MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MEN AND HOW BLACK WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WOMENMADDEN YEAH WE SAW THAT TENSION TOO IT WASNT JUST MEN THERE WERE A LOT OF BLACK WOMEN OUT THERE CAPING FOR TORY TOOBAILEY SOMETHING THAT I DONT THINK WEVE REALLY WRESTLED WITH  THE WAY THAT WE CAN INTERNALIZE THESE IDEAS ABOUT BLACK WOMEN EVEN AS BLACK WOMEN  THAT MISOGYNOIR UNFORTUNATELY  THAT ITS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF WHO DEPLOYS ITMADDEN YEPCARMICHAEL THIS TENSION THAT MOYAS TALKING ABOUT  ITS REAL AND ITS GOT EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW BLACK MEN HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY PREYED UPON BY THE CARCERAL STATE AND THE DESIRE TO KEEP MEN AND BOYS OUT OF THAT SYSTEMBAILEY I THINK FOR A LOT OF BLACK MEN THERE IS THIS SENSE THAT ANY OF US IS ALL OF US AND THAT IS TRUE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY ID SAY WE DO HAVE A LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER THAT I THINK IS REALLY POWERFUL BUT ALSO IN THIS CASE AS THE YOU KNOW BOONDOCKS CLIP ABOUT R KELLY SHOWS YOU KNOW NOT ALL OF US ARE POLITICAL PRISONERSCARMICHAEL LAUGHTERSOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW THE BOONDOCKSREGINA KING AS HUEY FREEMAN WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE EVERY FAMOUS N THAT GETS ARRESTED IS NOT NELSON MANDELA YES THE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRES TO PUT A LOT OF INNOCENT BLACK MEN IN JAIL ON FALLACIOUS CHARGES BUT R KELLY IS NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN WE ALL KNOW THE N CAN SING BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO STANDARDS WHAT HAPPENED TO BARE MINIMUMSBAILEY IT CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS STRUCTURALLY UNJUST PARTICULARLY TOWARDS BLACK MEN AND TORY LANEZ DID SHOOT MEGAN THEE STALLION THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND WE HAVENT REALLY HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT LOUDLYMADDEN FOR SOME TRYING TO HOLD THESE TWO TRUTHS AT THE SAME TIME CAN BE HARD BUT BLACK WOMEN DO IT ALL THE TIME THATS WHAT MEGAN DID SHE TRIED TO PROTECT TORY FROM THE POLICE EVEN AFTER SHE WAS SHOT BY HIMCARMICHAEL BUT TRYING TO PROTECT HIM DOESNT CHANGE THE FACTSMADDEN FACTS LIKE HOW IN THE US BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT THAN ANY OTHER RACIAL GROUPWHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO DONT THINK MISOGYNOIR ACTUALLY EXISTSBAILEY THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY IGNORING WHATS HAPPENING AROUND THEM THERES THIS QUOTE BY TONI CADE BAMBARA THAT I REALLY LOVE WHICH IS WHAT ARE YOU PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW AND SO PEOPLE CAN PRETEND NOT TO KNOW THAT MISOGYNOIR EXISTS BUT ITS A FARCE THE EVIDENCE IS THERE AND AT THIS POINT IF YOURE DENYING MISOGYNOIR THEN YOURE JUST DENYING REALITYMADDEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO DENY IT MAY EXIST BUT THE USE OF MISOGYNOIR AS A TERM EXPLODED DURING THE TRIAL IT CLIMBED  IN ONLINE SEARCH ENGINES DOZENS OF ARTICLES AND PODCASTS AND TIKTOKS POPPED UP ALL USING MISOGYNOIR AS A FRAMEWORK TO BREAK DOWN THIS MESSCARMICHAEL BUT IF ANYTHING THE POPULARITY OF THE TERM  IT ONLY HIGHLIGHTED THE PROBLEMBAILEY ID REALLY LIKE TO SEE MISOGYNOIR RETIRED SOMEDAY  AS SOMETHING WE DONT NEED TO USE OR ONLY THINK ABOUT IN THE PAST BECAUSE WEVE DONE THE WORK TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE MISOGYNOIR DOESNT EXISTMADDEN BUT AS THE TRIAL WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE IT WAS CLEAR THE DAY OF RETIRING THIS WORD WAS STILL A LONG WAY OFFWE JUST WRAPPED DAY CARMICHAEL WHERE ARE WEMADDEN WERE IN THE PARK BEHIND THE  BEHIND COURT THE PARK THAT WERE ALWAYS  WE ALWAYS GO TO WITH THE PINK CHAIRS AND EVERYTHINGAFTER MEG TESTIFIED THAT DAY IN COURT A SLEW OF PEOPLE TOOK THE STAND THE FACES AND THE FACTS MIGHT HAVE CHANGED FROM DAY TO DAY BUT THE MISOGYNOIR STAYED EVERPRESENTCARMICHAEL YEAH AND BY THE LAST DAY OF TESTIMONY WE WERE OVERWHELMED WITH HOW OFTEN WE COULD POINT IT OUTOK SO FOR ME WALKING INTO THIS THING ONLY BEING HERE TWO DAYS THE REAL SHOW WAS OUTSIDE THE COURTROOMMADDEN IT WAS A REALITY TV SHOW I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE THERES PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY PROMEGAN PEOPLE VERY PROTORY AND PEOPLES OPINIONS HAVE NOT SWAYED THEY BECAME MORE ENTRENCHED IN THEIR OPINIONSCARMICHAEL WALKING OUT OF COURT THAT DAY  THE DAY BEFORE DELIBERATIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO START  I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU SID BUT I FELT TIREDMADDEN YEAH I MEAN LISTENING TO SOME REALLY HARD TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE  THAT WAS A LOT BUT THE ATMOSPHERE OUTSIDE WAS A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL OF EXHAUSTINGCARMICHAEL IN TOTAL THE TRIAL ONLY TOOK TWO WEEKS BUT IN THAT TIME SOME OF THE LOUDEST NAMES IN HIPHOP WERE MAKING MISOGYNISTIC CONTENT OUT OF IT AND MONETIZING IT DJ AKADEMIKS HOSTED WATCH PARTIES ON TWITCH  CENT POSTED MEMES MAKING FUN OF MEG AND JOE BUDDEN  HE TALKED MAD TRASH ON HIS PODCASTMADDEN AS WE SAT OUT THERE IN THE COLD TRYING TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND JUST HOW BIG THIS MOMENT FELT AND WHAT THE VERDICT WAS GOING TO BE THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE SEEMED ONLY LIKE A SMALL PART OF WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ONCARMICHAEL IN SOME WAYS IT KIND OF REAFFIRMS THINGS THAT WEVE ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT  YOU KNOW THE CULTURE AND THE WORLD AND ALL OF THATMADDEN ITS LIKE REAFFIRMED IT BUT ITS ALSO AMPLIFIED IT TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLES THRESHOLD IS HIGHER  YOU KNOW WHAT IM SAYING LIKE YOU KNOW HOW

SUPER DISCOURAGED BY THATCARMICHAEL YEAH ITS FUNNY I MEAN THIS JUST FEELS LIKE ITS KIND OF PUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SPIN ON THE SEASON I MEAN THE NEED FOR THE SEASON THAT YOU KNOW WE SET OUT WITH IS OBVIOUSLY STILL AS CLEAR AS EVER AND THIS TRIAL REAFFIRMS THAT BUT I THINK THERE WAS A BIT OF A HOPE OR EXPECTATION THAT THINGS MIGHT BE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER A LITTLE BIT AND THATMADDEN I KNOW IT DID FEEL LIKE THERE WAS LIKE  I MEAN HOW THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW  I GUESS WE COULD CALL IT PROPAGANDA LIKE THE RENAISSANCE OF WOMEN IN RAP LIKE THIS NEW DAWN OF SO MANY RAP GIRLIES PUSHING NARRATIVES THAT ARE VERY AFFIRMING  IT DID FEEL LIKE THERE WAS A NEW TIDAL WAVE AND A NEW ENERGY AND SURGE OF THAT BUT COMING FROM THIS CASE ITS LIKE IT DONT FEEL LIKE ITCARMICHAEL NO IT FEELS LIKE ALL THAT KIND

PIRANHAS YEAH ALL THIS BISCOTTI I GOT IN MY WOOD  NEED SOMEBODY GROW ME A TREEMADDEN THIS IS THE SONG SKI BY YOUNG THUG AND GUNNA TWO OF ATLANTAS BIGGEST RAP SUPERSTARS WHOVE BEEN ARRESTED ON RICO CHARGES THUG AND GUNNA WERE AMONG THE NEARLY  PEOPLE NAMED EARLIER THIS MONTH IN A FULTON COUNTY GA INDICTMENT ONE THAT ALLEGES YSL AKA YOUNG SLIME LIFE IS AN ATLANTA AREA GANG NOW FANS OF THUGGER KNOW THAT HIS RECORD LABEL IS ALSO CALLED YSL AND GUNNA AS THUGS PROTEGE RELEASES MUSIC UNDER THAT OUTFIT GUNNA IS BEING CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE GEORGIAS RICO ACT WHILE THUGS BEING CHARGED WITH ONE COUNT OF CONSPIRACY AND ONE COUNT OF PARTICIPATION IN CRIMINAL STREET ACTIVITYTHE PAPERWORK THEY GOT ON THEM DATES AS FAR BACK AS  AND IT INCLUDES CHARGES RANGING FROM POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA TO ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON TO MURDER WHAT IT ALSO INCLUDES ARE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND RAP LYRICS FROM THUG AND GUNNA TRACKS LIKE ANYBODY ARE BEING ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE OF QUOTE OVERT ACT IN FURTHERANCE OF A CONSPIRACYSOUNDBITE OF SONG ANYBODYNICKI MINAJ THUGGERYOUNG THUG RAPPING I NEVER KILLED ANYBODY BUT I GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT BODY I GOT THE STREETS ON MY BACK CARRY IT LIKE IM MOVING A BODY I TOLD THEM TO SHOOT A HUNDRED ROUNDS LIKE HE TRYING TO MOVIE THE BODY IT WAS LIKE  IN THE MORNING SKIPPING SCHOOL  THATS A TRUANCY BODY I MADE ME SOME RACKS IN THE MORNINGMADDEN NOW WEVE TALKED TO YALL BEFORE ABOUT LYRICS BEING PUT ON TRIAL WITH THE CASE OF NEW ORLEANS RAPPER MAC PHIPPS AND THE RICO ACT BEING USED IN HIPHOP IN THE CASES OF DJ DRAMA AND BOBBY SHMURDA SO IF YOUVE HEARD THE SHOW BEFORE YOU KNOW THESE TACTICS ARE NOTHING NEW BUT YOU KNOW WHATS IRONIC ABOUT THIS INDICTMENT ITS THE VOLUME AND SPECIFICITY OF LYRICS ESPECIALLY THUGS CONSIDERING HIS UNORTHODOX  SOMETIMES EVEN CRITIQUED AS INCOHERENT  DELIVERY THATS COME TO DEFINE HIS CAREER HIS ARTISTRY AND HIS INFLUENCE IN RAP ITS ALMOST LIKE THE DA IS DOING A BETTER JOB WRITING OUT HIS LYRICS THAN GENIUS DOES THEY JUMP AROUND THUGS DISCOGRAPHY REFERENCING ALMOST TEN OF HIS SONGS IN THE INDICTMENTSOUNDBITE OF SONG SLIME SYOUNG THUG RAPPING YSL S HEY KILLING  S HEY F A JAIL S HEY DRINKING ACTAVIS HEY ON

OF FULTON COUNTY ADDRESSED THE USE OF LYRICS IN THE INDICTMENT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEKSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGFANI WILLIS I BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ITS ONE OF OUR MOST PRECIOUS RIGHTS HOWEVER THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT PROTECT PEOPLE FROM PROSECUTORS USING IT AS EVIDENCE IF IT IS SUCH IN THIS CASE WE PUT IT AS OVERT AND PREDICATE ACTS WITHIN THE RICO COUNT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT ISMADDEN WHOLE LOT OF CONTRADICTIONS HAPPENING HERE SO WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY HARD AT WORK ON SEASON  OF LOUDER THAN A RIOT RODNEY AND I HAD TO JUMP ON NPRS WEEKEND EDITION WITH AYESHA RASCOE TO BREAK DOWN THIS NEWS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS HERES THE CONVERSATIONAYESHA RASCOE BYLINE SO I MEAN JUST TO START OFF WITH CAN YOU TALK TO THE AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR WITH YOUNG THUG I MEAN HE IS A HUGE RAPPER LIKE WHEN THIS NEWS CAME DOWN MY SISTER CALLED ME UP IMMEDIATELY AND WAS LIKE THEY GOT THUG THEY GOT THUG I MEAN SHE  AND SHE LOVES HIPHOP AND SO LIKE YOUNG THUG IS HUGE RIGHTRODNEY CARMICHAEL HOST  YEAH I MEAN HES INARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ARTISTS IN HIPHOP AND POP MUSIC TODAY AND YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF ATLANTA WHICH IS ALSO WHERE IM FROM HES EASILY ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE ARTISTS TO COME OUT OF THIS CITY SINCE OUTKAST ELTON JOHN IS ONE OF HIS BIGGEST FANS THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOWRASCOE YEAH YEAH THAT SAYS A LOTMADDEN YEAH I MEAN HES BEEN MAKING NOISE IN ATLANTA FOR YEARS THROUGH MIXTAPES AND APPEARANCES FASHION AND AESTHETIC TRENDSETTING BUT EVEN OUTSIDE OF THOSE CITY LIMITS OF SUCH AN INFLUENTIAL PLACE IN HIPHOP YOUNG THUG HAS BECOME AN ICON FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WRIT LARGE HES A HUGE NAMERASCOE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LIKE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND RAPPERS RAPPERS GETTING CAUGHT UP IN DOING TIME IS NOT UNCOMMON RIGHTCARMICHAEL I MEAN THE TRUTH IS RAPPERS AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY  THEYRE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK SO YOU KNOW THAT MEANS  TIMES OUT OF  THEYRE COMING FROM COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HISTORICALLY OVERPOLICED REALLY JUST LIKE WALKING WHILE BLACK WAS LIKELY TO GET YOU STOPPED AND FRISKED IN NEW YORK IN THE EARLY S RAPPING WHILE BLACK WOULD DEFINITELY LAND YOU IN THE SURVEILLANCE LINEUP OF THE NYPDS HIPHOP DOSSIER BACK THENRASCOE WELL IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS GOING ON LIKE BEYOND JUST  OBVIOUSLY BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THESE RICO LAWS  I MEAN THEY WERE YOU KNOW DESIGNED TO TARGET LIKE ORGANIZED CRIME THE MOB YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE JOHN GOTTI LIKE THESE VERY INSTITUTIONALIZED LIKE ORGANIZATIONS BUT NOW WERE SEEING IT APPLY TO RAP CREWS OR WHAT YOU KNOW THE POLICE ARE CALLING GANGSMADDEN EXACTLY LIKE YOU SAID NOW RICO IS MOST COMMONLY USED AS A TACTIC TO SWEEP UP ENTIRE STREET GANGS AND THE DEFINITION OF A STREET GANG GETS REAL SPONGY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT COMING IN BLACK COMMUNITIES SO WHEN PROSECUTORS APPLY RICO TO RAP ITS NOT JUST THE RAPPERS GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM BUT ITS THEIR WHOLE CREW AND THEIR WHOLE ENTOURAGE SO IF YOURE A RAPPER AND YOU ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE ENGAGING IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY  MAYBE YALL GREW UP ON THE SAME BLOCK MAYBE YOU USED TO RUN THE SAME STREETS BEFORE YOU SWITCHED INTO ENTERTAINMENT MAYBE YOU BROUGHT THEM WITH YOU OUT OF THE STREETS INTO ENTERTAINMENT  PROSECUTORS CAN USE ALL THAT AND USE RICO LAWS TO BRAND YALL AS AN ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATERASCOE RODNEY I MEAN I GUESS LIKE WHEN YOURE CASTING A BIG NET LIKE THAT WHERE  YOU KNOW THE COMPLICATIONS TO ME WOULD SEEM LIKE IF YOU GREW UP WITH PEOPLE  THIS IDEA OF LIKE I GREW UP WITH PEOPLE THESE ARE MY FRIENDS THESE ARE MY BROTHERS LIKE WE GREW UP TOGETHER AND SO YEAH WE HANG OUT BUT THAT SEEMS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN NECESSARILY LIKE YOU KNOW THE MOB WHERE THERE IS A VERY STRICT HIERARCHY AND STRUCTURE LIKE I GUESS WHAT IM ASKING LIKE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A GANGCARMICHAEL NO THATS A GOOD QUESTION AND ITS ONE THAT WE REALLY ASKED AND PUZZLED OVER A LOT IN SEASON  OF LOUDER THAN A RIOT AND IN OUR REPORTING FOR THAT SEASON WE TALKED TO THIS GANG EXPERT AN ACADEMIC HER NAME WAS BABE HOWELL AND SHE REALLY BROKE DOWN FOR US THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GANGS IN THE MORE ORGANIZED SENSE AND REALLY JUST NEIGHBORHOOD CREWS THAT ARE WAY MORE UNORGANIZED AND TYPICALLY DRIVEN BY JUVENILES WHO SHE SAYS STUDIES SHOW ARE REALLY MORE LIKELY TO GROW OUT OF THAT YOUTHFUL CRIMINAL PHASE UNLESS THEY GET CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM AND THE THING ABOUT RICO WHEN ITS APPLIED TO RAP STARS  YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THE RAPPERS ARE NOT THE ONES ACCUSED OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS CRIMES BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR CELEBRITY AND SOMETIMES THE BELIEF THAT THEYRE BANKROLLING THE WHOLE OPERATION THEY ARE OFTEN PAINTED AS THE PROVERBIAL KINGPINSRASCOE THE OTHER THING THAT KIND OF MAKES THESE HIPHOP ARRESTS UNIQUE IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES THE LYRICS AND THE MUSIC VIDEOS THAT THEY MAKE  LIKE THEIR HIT SONGS FROM YOUNG THUG ARE BEING USED AS PART OF THE INDICTMENT AND THATS LIKE A GROWING TREND WHERE HIPHOP IS BEING USED  INSTEAD OF JUST AS ART ITS BEING USED AS NO THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE IN A GANG THAT THEYRE ALL TOGETHER AND THAT THEYRE ENGAGING IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITYMADDEN I MEAN THIS IS A TREND THATS REALLY LOUD RIGHT NOW IN THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS BUT ITS ACTUALLY A PRACTICE OF CRIMINALIZING HIPHOP OR JUST BLACK MUSIC IN GENERAL THATS A PATTERN THAT STRETCHES WAY WAY FAR BACK IN AMERICAS HISTORY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO RAP LYRICS BEING PUT ON TRIAL JUST LAST YEAR THE STATE OF MARYLANDS HIGHEST APPEALS COURT RULED THAT THE LYRICS ARE ADMISSIBLE AS EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES AND THIS DECISION STEMS FROM A MURDER CASE CONVICTION WHERE THE DEFENDANT WAS SENTENCED TO  YEARS AND HIS LYRICS WHICH HE RAPPED OVER A JAIL PAYPHONE THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE START OF HIS TRIAL WERE TAKEN BY THE JUDGE AS A CRIMINAL CONFESSIONAND MEANWHILE IN NEW YORK THERES A BILL BEING INTRODUCED TO ACTUALLY LIMIT THE USE OF RAP LYRICS BEING USED IN CRIMINAL CASES AS EVIDENCE BUT THIS BILL IS STILL BEING DEBATED ON IN NEW YORK SENATE AND IN  THE SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO HEAR A LYRICS ON TRIAL CASE DESPITE A LOT OF BIGNAME ARTISTS LIKE CHANCE THE RAPPER MEEK MILL AND KILLER MIKE ALL PUSHING FOR IT SO DECISIONS LIKE THESE CONTINUE TO SET LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND BECAUSE IT HAPPENS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN HIPHOP ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE IT THROUGH A LENS OTHER THAN A RACIAL ONERASCOE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO RAP LYRICS LIKE RAP LYRICS ARE TAKEN LITERALLY IN A WAY VERSUS YOU KNOW THIS  LIKE IF YOU RAP ABOUT  JUST BECAUSE YOU RAP ABOUT SELLING DRUGS DONT MEAN YOU ACTUALLY SELL DRUGS LIKE I COULD RAP ABOUT SELLING DRUGS BUT  BECAUSE I WATCH THE WIRE THAT DONT MEAN I ACTUALLY SOLD DRUGS RIGHT LIKECARMICHAEL RIGHTRASCOE I MEAN SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST FRONTING OR THEYRE TELLING STORIES THAT THEY SEE WITH OTHER PEOPLE RIGHTCARMICHAEL YEAH I MEAN IT REALLY SPEAKS TO ANOTHER THING WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT IN THE FIRST SEASON WHICH IS THE FACT THAT THE ARTISTIC MERITS OF HIPHOP ARE NOT JUDGED IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE FOR OTHER GENRES YOU KNOW ITS NOT SEEN AS CREATIVITY OR EVEN GENIUS AS MUCH AS ITS SEEN AS JUST AUTOBIOGRAPHY LIKE HOW CAN PEOPLE BE MAKING THESE STUFF UP PARTICULARLY BLACK KIDS THEY GOT TO JUST BE RAPPING WHAT THEY KNOW ITS SOMETHING THAT REALLY STRIKES AT THE DIFFERENT MORE PREJUDICIAL WAYS THAT BLACK ART AND BLACK MUSIC ARE JUDGED IN THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOWMADDEN JUDGED AND DEVALUED AND STIGMATIZED YEAHRASCOE YEAH AND YOU ALL  YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT THAT SEASON  OF LOUDER THAN A RIOT YOU CHRONICLED THE RISE OF RAPPER BOBBY SHMURDA AND THEN HIS INDICTMENT AND ARREST RIGHT AS HE WAS GETTING BIG AND HE SPENT YEARS IN PRISON AND WAS CAUGHT UP IN A CASE WHERE THE PROSECUTION SAID THAT HE WAS A PART OF A GANG AND THAT MAYBE HE WAS LIKE THE KINGPIN CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES TO WHAT HAPPENED TO BOBBY SHMURDA AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING TO YOUNG THUG AND GUNNA RIGHT NOWCARMICHAEL HERES REALLY THE DICHOTOMY THAT WERE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW BASICALLY WE HAVE A MUSIC INDUSTRY THAT REWARDS ARTISTS FOR EXPLOITING THEIR CONNECTION TO THE STREETS AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND WEVE GOT A JUSTICE SYSTEM THATS DEAD SET ON CRIMINALIZING THOSE SAME CONNECTIONS YOU KNOW WHETHER THEYRE REAL CONNECTIONS WHETHER THEYRE DRAMATIZED LIKE WE WERE SAYING BEFORE SO FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SEDUCED BY THE LIMELIGHT AND REALLY OFTENTIMES JUST LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT OF THE STREETS RAPPING ABOUT WHERE YOURE FROM AND THE THINGS THAT YOU OR YOUR PEOPLE USED TO DO IN THE STREETS  IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EARNING YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR OR YEARS IN PRISON AND IF YOURE AN ICON LIKE YOUNG THUG YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN BOTHSOUNDBITE OF MUSICMADDEN NOW ATLANTA AND HIPHOP WAS ALREADY REELING FROM THIS INDICTMENT BUT AFTER WE SPOKE WITH AYESHA MORE NEWS BROKE THAT NEW YORK BILL WE TALKED ABOUT THATD RESTRICT RAP LYRICS BEING USED AS EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL CASES  IT PASSED IN THE SENATE THIS WEEK NOW ITS UP TO THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE IT LAW AND LIL KEED ANOTHER YSL RECORD SIGNEE DIED UNEXPECTEDLY AT JUST  YEARS OLD SHORTLY AFTER THE CHARGES CAME DOWN HE WASNT INCLUDED IN THIS INDICTMENT BUT BEFORE HIS PASSING KEED WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO POST ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WRITING YSL IS A LABEL AND A WAY OF LIFE NOT A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONSOUNDBITE OF MUSICMADDEN LOUDER THAN A RIOT INVESTIGATES THE

BRITTANY ITS GREAT TO TALK TO YOU AGAINLUSE COMING UP REPORTER SUSAN TOMPOR OF THE DETROIT FREE PRESS JOINS US TO GIVE SOME TIPS ON HOW TO SPOT A GRIFT AND HOW PEERTOPEER PAYMENT APPS LIKE ZELLE ARE AT THE CENTER OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SCAMS BUT FIRST SOME LISTENER SCAM STORIES STAY TUNEDWHEN WE FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS PIECE WE ASKED YOU OUR LISTENERS TO SHARE YOUR SCAM STORIES AND I WAS STRUCK BY THE RANGEUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  THEY WERE LIKE HEY WE SENT YOU SOME MAIL ABOUT LIKE BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT DEBT RELIEF PROGRAM THEIR WEBSITE LOOKS LEGIT ALL OF THEIR PAPERWORK LOOKS LEGIT AND THEY SCAMMED ME OUT OF ALL THIS MONEYUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  I WAS TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF MY DAD ON A THURSDAY I COULDNT GET A HOLD OF HIM HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT HE HAD WON A  MILLION LOTTERY BUT HE FIRST HAD TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO SATISFY THE IRS ON  IN TERMS OF TAXES OF UNIDENTIFIED PERSON  I PERSONALLY WASNT SCAMMED HOWEVER MY INLAWS WERE AND IT ALL CENTERED AROUND SOME HORRIBLE PEOPLE CALLING MY INLAWS AND STATING TO THEM THAT MY SON THEIR GRANDSON WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND IN JAIL AND THEY NEEDED MONEY FOR SURGERY AND THEY NEEDED MONEY TO GET HIM OUT OF JAIL ALL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN WAS A SINGLE CELLPHONE CALL BUT THEY PUSHED THAT EMOTIONAL BUTTON WITH MY INLAWS AND MY INLAWS LOST  AND THE POLICE SAID NOTHING THEY COULD DOLUSE LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO IDENTIFY A SCAM BECAUSE THERES GRIFTS EVERY DAY BUT HERE TO HELP POINT OUT SOME TYPICAL SCAM BEHAVIOR AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS IS SUSAN TOMPOR SUSAN TOMPOR OF THE DETROIT FREE PRESS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY ON ITS BEEN A MINUTESUSAN TOMPOR WELL THANK YOU THANKS FOR HAVING ME THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICSLAUGHTERLUSE I MEAN I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE BOON THAT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS GIVEN YOU CAUSE I FEEL LIKE SCAMMERS ARE EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOWTOMPOR OH MY GOD YOU KNOW I COUNTED HOW MANY TIMES I WROTE A COLUMN ON SCAMS LAST YEAR AND  LITERALLY  TIMES OR MORE AND IM LIKE WHATLUSE OH MY GOSHTOMPOR THATS TOO MUCHLUSE I MEAN YOU HAVE COVERED ALL TYPES OF SCAMS YOU COVERED FAKE PUPPY SCAMS ON EBAY FAKE JOB POSTINGS PHISHING AMAZON GIFT CARD SCAMS CRYPTO ATM SCAMS YOUR WORK RUNS THE GAMUT IS THERE LIKE AN ANATOMY A COMMON ANATOMY OF THESE SCAMS THAT YOUVE ENCOUNTERED OR HEARD ABOUT IN YOUR REPORTINGTOMPOR ONE THING THAT IS COMMON IS THEY OFTEN AS SOME EXPERTS CALL IT GET INTO THE ETHER WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GET YOU GOING AND THEY CONVINCE YOU WELL THIS IS PART OF A NEW PROCESS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WAY WERE DOING THINGS AND THEY RUSH YOU THEY PUT YOU IN A STATE WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO ACT RIGHT NOW IF I DONT ACT RIGHT NOW I WONT GET THE JOB IF I DONT ACT RIGHT NOW THE IRS IS GOING TO COME KNOCKING ON MY DOOR OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL COME AKNOCKING ON MY DOOR ANOTHER THING THAT WAS HUGE OR BEEN HUGE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS THE AMAZON SCAM BECAUSE THEYLL SAY SOMEBODY HAS GONE INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AND CHARGED  FOR AN IPHONE THEYLL TEXT YOU ON THIS BUT ODDLY ENOUGH IT GOES FROM AMAZON TO A US MARSHAL TO MONEY LAUNDERING AND SOMETIMES THEYVE GOT YOU GOING TO A WALMART OR SOME OTHER STORE TO BUY GIFT CARDS A TARGET TO BUY GIFT CARDS AND YOURE READING THEM OFF THE NUMBERS IN THE PARKING LOTLUSE WOWTOMPOR PART OF IT IS BECAUSE WE WERE SO ISOLATED DURING THE PANDEMIC WE DONT TALK TO ONE ANOTHER AS MUCH IM NOT SURE WHY OUR MENTAL STATE IS LIKE THIS BUT WERE VERY VULNERABLE TO IT EVERYBODYS VULNERABLE TO ITLUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE COMMON THREADS IS THIS LIKE SENSE OF URGENCY AS YOU MENTIONED YOU MUST ACT NOW AND THAT PRESSURE AS YOU MENTIONED GETS VICTIMS TO DO THINGS THAT THEY UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NOT DO OR AT LEAST WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK SCAMMERS ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BY CREATING THIS FALSE SENSE OF URGENCY IN THEIR VICTIMSTOMPOR THEYRE TRYING TO STOP YOU FROM INTERACTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WHO MIGHT CORRECT THE SITUATION SO THEY KEEP YOU ON THE LINE THEY TELL YOU NOT TO HANG UP VICTIMS TELL ME THAT THE SCAMMER TOLD THEM WHEN THEY WENT TO THE BANK TELL THEM YOURE TAKING THE MONEY OUT FOR CARPETING BECAUSE THEYRE GOING TO ASK YOU WHY YOURE TAKING THE MONEY OUT THEY DONT WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMEONE STOP YOULUSE I ALSO FEEL LIKE THOSE TYPES OF SCAMS END UP PUTTING YOU IN A POSITION WHERE LIKE AS A VICTIM YOU MAY BE MORE PRONE TO USING AN APP LIKE ZELLE OR VENMO OR CASH APP TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW USING AN APP LIKE THAT MIGHT LEAVE A VICTIM MAYBE MORE VULNERABLE THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN SCAMMED IN SOME OTHER WAYTOMPOR WHATS COME UP WITH ZELLE AND SOME OF THESE PAYMENT APPS PEOPLE REALLY ARENT THAT FAMILIAR WITH HOW THEY CAN BE SCAMMED WITH THEM THEYRE USED TO USING THEM WITH THEIR FRIENDS YOU HAVENT HEARD THE WARNINGS QUITE AS MUCH NO  THEY USE A SOPHISTICATED WAY TO GET INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT THROUGH THESE APPS AND THATS WHERE IT BECOMES ALMOST LIKE A GIFT CARD SITUATION WHERE YOURE NOT GOING TO GET THAT MONEY BACK IF YOUVE GIVEN ACCESS TO SOMEBODY TO SAY BUY A PUPPY ON ZELLE AND ITS A SCAMMER ITS NOT A REAL PUPPY YOUVE LOST THAT MONEY WELL IT BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE BANKS ARE SAYING OFTEN YOURE THE ONE AUTHORIZING THISLUSE RIGHT RIGHTTOMPOR THEY DONT EVEN REALIZE THAT ACCESS WAS GRANTED TO A CHECKING ACCOUNT ALL SORTS OF DIRECTION THAT THEYRE GIVING YOU TO FIX A PROBLEM OR TO HANDLE SOMETHING AND ONE THING THAT I WROTE ABOUT EARLY THIS YEAR IS THAT MANY CONSUMERS WERE STARTING TO HEAR SUPPOSEDLY FROM THEIR BANK SAYING THAT THEYVE BEEN VICTIMIZED AND ITS NOT THE BANK THATS CALLING ITS THE SCAMMER AND THEN THE SCAMMERS IMPERSONATING THE BANKLUSE RIGHTTOMPOR AND SO  YESLUSE RIGHTTOMPOR SO IT GETS REALLY PRETTY BADLUSE YEAH THATS WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS ON THE SHOW THATS HOW WE  THATS PART OF WHY WERE TALKING TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE SHE WAS SCAMMED IN THAT WAY HOW IS USING THESE APPS DIFFERENT FROM USING A CREDIT CARD OR A DEBIT CARD IN A SITUATION LIKE THISTOMPOR NO PROTECTION ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTION YOU KNOW IF YOU USE A CREDIT CARD MOST OF THE TIME YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE BUT WITH THESE APPS THERE IS NO PROTECTION AND YOU KNOW ITS FINE IF YOURE ONLY SENDING  TO A FRIEND PROBABLY RIGHT BUT ITS NOT EVEN FINE THEN BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GET THE NUMBER WRONG AND THEY WANT US TO USE THESE APPS MORELUSE WAIT SO I WONDER  OK SO  I MEAN I HAVE A COUPLE THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS BUT WHY IS IT THAT THERE ARE NO PROTECTIONS WHY IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN IF SOMEBODY LIKE YOU KNOW USES A CARD WIPER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SWIPES MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION WHY ARE THOSE TWO THINGS SO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENTTOMPOR I DONT KNOW I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHY THEYRE DIFFERENT THE LAW IS WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS AND IT DATES BACK TO THE S AND SO SOME OF THESE THINGS WERENT IN PLACE AND SOME OF THE LAW NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED OBVIOUSLY THE BANKS DONT WANT TO BE COVERING YOU EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A MISTAKE BUT YET THEYLL DO IT WITH A CREDIT CARD THERES A LAW THAT PROTECTS YOU WITH A CREDIT CARD AND THERE ISNT WITH AN APPLUSE HOW DO BANKS AGENCIES AND COMPANIES RESPOND TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE THE THE VICTIMS OF SCAMS THAT HAPPEN THROUGH THE AID OF PEERTOPEER APPSTOMPOR THEYRE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION SOMETIMES THEYLL GIVE YOU THE MONEY ON HOLDLUSE RIGHTTOMPOR AND YOU KNOW PUT IT BACK IN YOUR ACCOUNT BUT WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY DETERMINE THAT YOU KNOW YOU GAVE THEM ACCESS THATS THE THING DID YOU GIVE THEM ACCESS DID YOU GIVE THE SCAMMERS ACCESS TO THE ACCOUNT IN SOME WAY THATS WHEN IT BECOMES A PROBLEM AND THATS WHEN THEY DO BACK OUT SO I GUESS THE ONE WAY TO SAY THIS IS IF SOMEBODY CAME IN AND TOOK THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOU WERENT EVEN EVER ONLINE THEN THAT WOULD BE PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT IF SOMEHOW YOU GAVE THEM YOUR ATM CARD AND THE PASSWORD YOURE RESPONSIBLE ITS WHETHER YOUVE GIVEN THEM ACCESS AND THATS THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONE WOMAN I INTERVIEWED I THINK IT WAS AN ENERGY SCAM WHERE THE UTILITY  YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE IMPERSONATED THE UTILITY THE BANK TOLD HER THEY WERE GIVING THE MONEY BACK SHE SAW THE MONEY BACK AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE THAT THEY WERENT GIVING HER THE MONEY BACKLUSE WHATTOMPOR YES LAUGHTERLUSE WELL SO SHE HAD THE MONEY BACK AND THEN THE MONEY WAS GONETOMPOR RIGHTLUSE OH NO IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE YOUVE MADE A DELINEATION BETWEEN FRAUD WHICH IS SOMEBODY MAKING THEIR WAY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AND DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH YOUR MONEY  RIGHT  OR IMPERSONATING YOU SO THAT THEY CAN GET YOUR FUNDS AND SCAMMING WHICH IS SOMEBODY CONS YOU INTO TRUSTING THEM WITH YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION I THINK WEVE BEEN TALKING AROUND THIS IDEA OF A STIGMA AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SCAMMED AS OPPOSED TO BEING DEFRAUDED WHY DO YOU THINK THERES SUCH A STIGMA AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SCAMMED WHEN THEY ARE ALSO VICTIMS TOOTOMPOR WELL WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THIS TYPE OF COVERAGE SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO A LOT OF THE FOCUSES I MENTIONED WAS ON ELDERLY CONSUMERS AND THERE WAS A STIGMA THERE THAT THE SCAMMERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE THE ELDERLY WOULDNT WANT TO ADMIT THAT THEY HAD BEEN SCAMMED BECAUSE THATS ANOTHER SIGN THAT THEY CANT HANDLE THINGS AND THEIR FAMILY CAN SOMETIMES TURN AGAINST THEM YOU KNOW SAY WELL YOU CANT HANDLE THIS YOU NEED TO GO INTO ASSISTED LIVING YOU CANT LIVE ALONE YOU KNOW YOURE NOT RESPONSIBLE BUT THEN I THINK IT KIND OF GOES INTO OTHER GROUPS TOO PEOPLE DONT WANT TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE WELL YOU KNOW I LOOK FOOLISH BECAUSE I DID THIS OR  AND THEN THE SCAMMER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARENT REPORTING THE SCAM AND THEN THE WORD DOESNT GET OUT WELL HOW ARE THEY SCAMMING PEOPLELUSE GOD YOU KNOW WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE SCAMS AND SCAMMERS AND THERES ONE BIG THING THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN CONSISTENTLY AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM BIG NAMES LIKE THE TINDER SWINDLER TO AMAZON GIFT CARD SCAMMERS LIKE THE ONES YOU MENTIONED IT FEELS LIKE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH IT WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BRING SCAMMERS TO JUSTICETOMPOR I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT SOMETIMES ITLL BE A CRIME RING LIKE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THATS YOU KNOW DIFFICULT TO CRACK DOWN ON AND YOU KNOW ITS IMPORTANT TO LOCK YOUR CAR DOORS ITS IMPORTANT NOT TO KEEP YOUR KEYS IN YOUR CAR THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND STEALS YOUR CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHEN YOURE AT TARGET THERES A THEFT INVOLVED RIGHT AND I COMPARE THAT TO WHATS GOING ON WITH YOUR MONEY YOU KNOW THEY COME IN AND THEY STEAL IT SO THERES A THEFTAND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE IF YOURE  IF THE CONSUMER IS PICKING UP THE TAB ON ALL THESE THEFTS THEN THERES NO WAY YOURE GOING TO GET IMPROVED ENFORCEMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERES TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE YOU KNOW BUT IF THE BANKS HAVE TO PICK UP THE TAB WELL THEN MAYBE I THINK THEYD FIGURE SOMETHING OUT MAYBE IM BEING A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE HERE BUT LAUGHTER THEY FIGURE OUT ITS A PROBLEMLUSE YOU KNOW AND THINKING ABOUT I GUESS HOPING THAT THESE NUMBERS OF SCAMS GO DOWN I WONDER WHOS ACTUALLY MAKING EFFORTS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AS OPPOSED TO LIKE YOU KNOW BEING THERE ON THE OTHER END SAYING I TOLD YOU SO YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN COULD YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE LAWMAKERS WHO ARE MAKING NOISE ABOUT THIS ISSUETOMPOR OH ELIZABETH WARREN HAS BEEN VERY LOUD ON THIS ISSUE LATELYSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGELIZABETH WARREN AND THE OVERALL NUMBERS ARE ENORMOUS WE KNOW OF AT LEAST A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN TRANSACTIONS  MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU BUT TO THE PERSON WHO JUST LOST  ITS A LOT OF MONEY TO THEMTOMPOR SOME OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING ON IT AS WELL IN TERMS OF SOME OF THESE OTHER SCAMS I THINK THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DO HAVE THE FBI WORKING ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT I DONT REALLY KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH PROGRESS IS BEING MADELUSE IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION I SHOULD SAY WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO DETECT A SCAMTOMPOR TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM A SCAM UNFORTUNATELY MUCH OF IT INVOLVES NOT INTERACTING WITH PEOPLELAUGHTERLUSE THE ONLY WAY TO STAY SAFEWARREN ITS REALLY  ITS JUST GOTTEN TO THE POINT YOU KNOW I HATE TO SAY IT BUT YOU CANT ANSWER YOUR PHONE YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU RECOGNIZE THE NUMBER YOU CANT TALK TO STRANGERS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT REALLY IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY SOCIAL AND THEYRE TRUSTING YOU KNOW YOURE GOING TO INTERACT BUT THE MINUTE YOU START INTERACTING IS THE MINUTE THEY CAN START WEAVING BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONTROL THEYVE DONE THIS  MILLION TIMES BEFOREANOTHER WAY I THINK TO PROTECT YOURSELF IS WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS ASKING FOR NUMBERS OF ANY SORT  YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IF SOMEBODY STARTS TRYING TO SCARE YOU WITH A STORY OF ANY SORT WHETHER IT BE THEYRE GOING TO SHUT DOWN YOUR ELECTRICITY BECAUSE YOU HAVENT PAID THE BILL WHETHER IT BE THE IRS ITS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW IF IM RETIRED I MAY BE A TARGET BECAUSE I HAVE A K OR I MAY HAVE SOME MONEY IF IM A NONENGLISH SPEAKER IM LIKELY TO BE TARGETEDLUSE WHAT CAN OR SHOULD THEY DO IF THEY ARE SCAMMEDTOMPOR IF YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED I THINK ITS IMPORTANT TO REACH OUT TO YOUR CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT THE FTCGOV YOU WANT TO REPORT ANYTHING IN TERMS OF IDENTITY THEFT YOU NEED TO TALK WITH YOUR BANK YOU DO HAVE TO CHANGE THOSE  THAT INFORMATION TO STOP THEM FROM GAINING ACCESS YOU KNOW IT IS ALSO RECOMMENDED BY THE EXPERTS TO GOOGLE THINGSLUSE HONESTLY THATS BEEN MY FRIEND ANY TIME ANYBODY CALLS ME FROM LIKE A NUMBER THAT I DONT RECOGNIZE I GOOGLE IT TO SEE WHAT THE  I GOOGLE IT TO SEE LIKE WHERE THE CALL IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM I WOULDNT SAY NECESSARILY THAT IM ANY MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON I JUST  I THINK IVE BEEN MORE LUCKYTOMPOR PERFECT BUT THE SCAMMERS SOMETIMES ARE ABLE TO IMPERSONATE REAL NUMBERSLUSE THATS EXACTLY  NOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO OUR PRODUCER AND THAT HAPPENING TO HER THAT PUT ME ON NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS LIKE OH MY GOSH THAT WAS MYGO TO CRUTCH GOOGLING THE NUMBER TO SEE IF THAT WAS ITTOMPOR SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SOMETIMES ITS BEST TO GOLUSE THROUGH THE WEBSITETOMPOR TO THE BACK OF YOUR CREDIT CARD THE BACK OF YOUR ATM CARD AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL STATEMENT TO GET THE RIGHT NUMBERLUSE OH MY GOSH

THE CK YEAH THAT WAS LIKE THE DOMINANT CULTURE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THATS WHAT I CAME OF AGE UNDER I DONT KNOW WHY BUT IVE JUST BEEN GETTING FED A LOT OF LIFESTYLE CONTENT PARTICULARLY AROUND PILATES HIGHPROTEIN LOWCARB DIETS AND I THINK AT A CERTAIN POINT I WAS LIKE I THINK THEY JUST WANT ME TO BE A SKINNY WHITE WOMAN CAUSE THATS ALL THAT IM SEEINGLUSE IN YOUR ESSAY YOU MENTIONED DIFFERENT TRENDS  CLEAN GIRL HASHTAGS LIKE BALLETCORESOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  THE SAME WAY AS THE MODEL OFF DUTY LOOK IT STILL GIVES THAT EFFORTLESS CHIC ONTHEGO VIBE BUT WITH WARMER CLOTHING ITEMS LIKE LEG WARMERS HERE OR BOLEROSLUSE BUT A RECENT ONE THAT HAS SEEMED TO SPARK A LOT OF DISCUSSION IS THE VANILLA GIRL WHICH GLAMOUR UK SAID IS SHAPING UP TO BE ONE OF TIKTOKS BIGGEST TRENDS OF THE YEARCAO YEAHLUSE WHAT IS THE VANILLA GIRL AND WHY HAS THIS TREND SPARKED SO MUCH IRE IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER ONESCAO FOR ME VANILLA GIRL IS LITERALLY LIKE THE COLOR VANILLA EVERYTHING IS PALE AND CREAM AND WHITE AND EGGSHELLSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  THE COLOR PALETTE OF THE VANILLA GIRL AESTHETIC IS NOT VERY EXTENSIVE BUT IT IS EXCLUSIVE THERES NOT A LOT OF VARIATION HERE ITS CREAM WHITE BEIGE WHAT I WOULD CALL A LATTE COLOR YOU DONT WANT TO GO TOO BROWN BECAUSE THEN YOURE HEADING INTO CINNAMON GIRL TERRITORY AND THATS JUST LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENTCAO AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SEE VANILLA GIRL  I THINK PART OF IT IS LIKE THIS DISCOURSE AROUND I DONT THINK THIS ONES FOR ME I DONT THINK THIS ONES FOR YOU I DONT THINK THIS ONES FOR A LOT OF PEOPLELUSE RIGHT YEAHSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  THIS TREND IS  IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF LIKE WHITE CLOTHES AND LIKE WHITE ITEMS AND SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW LIKE WHY DO WE NAME THINGS CERTAIN THINGSCAO AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF ALL THESE LIKE VERY WHITE TRENDS THESE LIKE  NOT LIKE WHITE AS IN THE WOMAN PARTICIPATING BUT LITERALLY THE COLOR WHITE WHICH THEN ALSO DETERMINES THE INFLUENCERS WHO CAN BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN ITLUSE RIGHTCAO VANILLA GIRL FOR ME IS ONE IM LIKE EVERYTHING IS LITERALLY WHITE IT IS A VERY  TO ME ITS A SUNKEN PLACE AESTHETICLUSE YEAH I MEAN ITS PRETTY ON THE NOSE LIKE TO YOUR POINT I CANT IMAGINE WHAT THE RESPONSE WOULD EVEN BE FROM THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE IF I WALKED AROUND REFERRING TO MYSELF AS A VANILLA GIRL LAUGHTERCAO RIGHTLUSE LIKE I THINK MY PARENTS WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY HAD FAILED ME IN SOME WAYCAO LAUGHTERLUSE BUT WHOS LIKE THE SHINING STAR OF THE CLEAN GIRL BEAUTY AESTHETIC RIGHT NOW IS THERE A CELEBRITY THAT OUR LISTENERS MIGHT KNOW ABOUT WHO REALLY IS LIKE THE PICTURE OF THE CLEAN GIRLCAO I THINK FOR A LONG TIME IT MAY HAVE BEEN HAILEY BIEBERSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGHAILEY BIEBER HI IM HAILEY BIEBER AND I AM HERE TO ANSWER BAZAARS BURNING BEAUTY QUESTIONS I DO REALLY LIKE CHILL MAKEUP  LIKE VERY NATURAL JUST GLOWY DEWY IVE LEARNEDCAO HAILEY BIEBER WAS REALLY A VERY POPULAR SEARCH TERM FOR A LOT OF THESE SIMPLE SILHOUETTES AND THE BASIC NAIL AND THE QUOTEUNQUOTE BROWNIEGLAZED LIP THAT SHE GOT CALLED OUT FOR BECAUSE ITS A VERY BIG PART OF LIKE S LATINA CULTURELUSE TO HAVE LIKE THE BROWN LIP LINER WITH LIKE A MUCH LIGHTERCAO RIGHTLUSE LIPSTICK OR LIP GLOSS AND LIKE BLENDING IT TOGETHERCAO RIGHT YEAH SO THE CLEAN GIRL IS MARKETABLE IN THE WAY OF ITS ATTAINABLE AND IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU BUT HAS THEIR LIFE TOGETHER I THINK THE BEAUTY OF THE CLEAN GIRL IS THAT ITS SO SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE SHE COULD BE ANY GIRL WITHIN A SPECIFIC GUIDELINE LAUGHTERLUSE THEY SEEM TO BRING US BACK TO DEFINITELY VERY STEREOTYPICAL GENDER ROLES AND I SEE THAT KIND OF CONNECTED TO A LOT OF THE TRADWIFE OR TRADITIONAL WIFE CONTENT THAT I SEE ONLINECAO YEAHLUSE WHICH HAS ALSO BECOME REALLY POPULAR OVER THE PAST FEW YEARSSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGUNIDENTIFIED PERSON  WITH MY TRADITIONAL VALUES A DESIRE TO BE A BUSY STAYATHOME MOTHER OF MANY CHILDREN MY COOKING SKILLS AND FEMININE STYLE I THINK I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED BEING A S WOMANLUSE WHAT MIGHT IT SIGNAL THAT SO MANY WHITE WOMEN ON THE INTERNET APPEAR TO BE LEANING BACK INTO THESE TRADITIONAL FEMININE IDEALS OF THE PASTCAO ALL OF THESE THINGS ALL THESE TRENDS THAT WE SEE ONLINE PLAY TO POWER THE STAYATHOME GIRLFRIEND  ON THE SURFACE BEING IM RECLAIMING MY POWER AS SOMEONE WHO DOESNT WANT TO WORK AND YOU KNOW WHAT I ACTUALLY DO LOVE STAYING AT HOME AND NONE OF THESE THINGS SEEM BAD IN ESSENCE BUT THEY FALL BACK INTO I GUESS QUOTEUNQUOTE TRADITIONAL FAMILY ROLES OF THE WIFE BEING AT HOME AND THINGS LIKE THE DRAMA THAT HAPPENED WITH WIVES WHO ARE PACKING LUNCHES FOR THEIR LINEMAN HUSBANDS LAUGHTERLUSE THE COMPETITION AROUND WHOS PERFORMING BETTER AT THESE TYPES OF IDEALSCAO RIGHT IT DOES ALL FEEL RELATED IN SOME WAY TO VERY TRADITIONAL FORMS OF MISOGYNY AND HEGEMONY THE SIMULTANEOUS RISE OF TRADITIONAL WIFE CULTURE AS WELL AS THE RETURN TO A VERY I WOULD SAY BORING BUT LIKE A VERY TRADITIONAL FORM OF BEAUTY OF LIKE WHITENESS AND THINNESS AND HYPERFEMININITY  I DONT THINK THEIR SIMULTANEOUS RISE IS COINCIDENTAL AND SO WHEN I SEE ALL THESE AESTHETICS WHEN I SEE CLEAN GIRL COASTAL GRANDMA BEIGE GIRL VANILLA GIRL TO ME IT DOES FEEL LIKE A VERY STRONG MESSAGING BY WHITE WOMEN WHO HAVE POLITICALLY FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND WANT TO BE SEEN AS THE APEX OF FEMININITY ONCE MORESOUNDBITE OF MUSICLUSE COMING UP STEFFI AND I UNPACK HOW SOFT POWER AND BEAUTY POLITICS WORK HAND IN HANDSOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS FLICKERLUSE SO WHEN YOU SAY POLITICALLY FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THATCAO YEAH SO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW MILEY CYRUS WAS  SHE WAS HIGH OFF PURP WITH HER JS ONSOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGMILEY CYRUS SINGING TATTED UP MINISKIRT WITH MY JS ONCAO SHE WAS YOU KNOW TWERKING AT THE VMAS AND IT WAS THIS ATTEMPT IN OUR CULTURE TO BE AS CLOSE TO BLACKNESS AS POSSIBLE WHILE NOT SUFFERING WHAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY GOES THROUGH IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND I WOULD SAY SINCE THAT ERA THERE HAS BEEN MORE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WHITE WOMEN ARE ALSO OPPRESSORS AND SO AS I TALK ABOUT IN MY ESSAY YOU KNOW WE WATCHED SO MANY VIDEOS OF KARENS HAVING MELTDOWNS CALLING THE POLICE ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE WAS A DEMAND FOR WHITE WOMEN TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES SO POLITICALLY WHITE WOMEN HAVE FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR AND BECOME LESS COOL AND SO NOW FOR ME IT FEELS LIKE AN ATTEMPT AT SOFT POWER CAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN AND THE COOL JAPAN INITIATIVE THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO EXPORT CULTURE ANIME AND VIDEO GAMESLUSE LIKE IN THE POSTWAR ERACAO RIGHT  IN ORDER TO APPEAL MORE HARMLESS AND FRIENDLY AS A NATION TO THE WORLD IT FEELS LIKE A SIMILAR RESPONSE NOWLUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOURE SAYING IS WHITE WOMEN CANNOT NECESSARILY BE ASSUMED INNOCENT OF RACISM OR INNOCENT OF HARM BASICALLY CULTURALLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WEVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE SO MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW WHITE WOMEN CAN ALSO PARTICIPATE IN WHITE SUPREMACY ITS ALMOST LIKE THERES THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE IS WHAT YOURE SAYINGCAO YESLUSE THROUGH THESE AESTHETICS TO TAKE HOLD OF SOME OF THE ONLY TYPE OF POWER CAPITALCAO YEAHLUSE THATS AVAILABLE TO MOST WOMEN WHICH IS BEAUTYCAO ABSOLUTELY LIKE AS YOU SAID WHITE WOMEN HAVE LONG HELD THIS CURRENCY IN VICTIMHOOD IN BEING THE PERFECT VICTIM IT BECOMES HARDER TO MAINTAIN A SENSE OF PURITY OF COOLNESS TO A WIDER SOCIETY THAT NO LONGER FULLY BUYS INTO IT ANYMORE AND SO FOR ME IT FELT LIKE A VERY DIRECT RESPONSE TO OUR POLITICS AND BEYOND THAT OUR MOVEMENT FOR JUSTICELUSE ITS ALMOST LIKE THE TREND OF LOOKING MORE QUOTEUNQUOTE RACIALLY OR ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS IS OVER OR AT LEAST SUNSETTING FOR WHITE WOMEN WHO POPULARIZED IT I MEAN EVEN THE KARDASHIANSCAO RIGHTLUSE WHO HAVE LONG BORROWED FROM BLACK AESTHETICS TO SET TRENDSCAO RIGHTLUSE THEYVE APPEARED TO BECOME LESS CURVACEOUS AND THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO MARILYN MONROE AND PAMELA ANDERSON FOR INSPIRATION YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS WHO SPEND VERY LITTLE TIME ON THE INTERNET PEOPLE WHO THINK A CLEAN GIRL IS SIMPLY A PERSON WHO HAS SHOWERED WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER TO THEMCAO HOW YOU CHOOSE TO VIEW YOUR OWN BODY IN THIS WIDER SOCIETY IS INHERENTLY A VERY POLITICAL ACT WHICH IS WHY THINGS LIKE THE BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT THAT WE SEE ONLINE IS SUCH A BIG DEAL ONE BUT ALSO ITS HARDER TO SELL THAT TO A WIDER SYSTEM THAT WANTS TO PROFIT OFF OF INSECURITY AND SO BEAUTY POLITICS IS INHERENTLY TIED TO WIDER NOTIONS OF POWER OF WHO IS AT THE TOP WHO IS THE COOLEST PERSON IN THE ROOM AND THEN HOW THEN FROM THERE YOU POLICE YOUR OWN SELF YOU POLICE YOUR OWN CHOICES AND HOW YOU PERCEIVE OTHERS AS WELLLUSE WELL THAT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR ARTICLE YOU MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE HOW WHITE WOMEN HAVE BEEN  REALLY YOU UNPACK IN THE ARTICLE HOW WHITE WOMEN HAVE BEEN COOPTING EAST ASIAN CULTURE BUT ON OUR TEAM SOME PEOPLE FELT THAT MANY OF THE EAST ASIAN BEAUTY TRENDS DEVELOPED OUTSIDE OF EUROPEAN WHITENESS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR WHITE WOMEN TO COOPT THAT AESTHETIC AND BRING IT HERE AND ALSO I WONDER WHAT ASSUMPTIONS ARE THEY MAKING ABOUT EAST ASIAN WOMEN THAT THIS IS AN AESTHETIC THAT THEY WANT TO INTERPRET AT THIS MOMENTCAO I DO THINK IT IS INTERESTING IN THAT WAY THIS PERCEPTION OF EAST ASIAN WOMEN IN WESTERN LIFESTYLE CONTENT AND I THINK THAT LENS  IN HAND BECAUSE EAST ASIAN WOMEN ARE OFTEN CONCEPTUALIZED AS ALSO VERY HYPERFEMININE ALSO VERY LIKE TRADWIFE THEYRE FETISHIZED AS THESE DOCILE QUIET APOLITICAL BEINGS RIGHT SO I THINK IT FITS WELL IN WITH THIS ATTEMPT OF WHITE GIRL SOFT POWER BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE FACTORS JUST LINE UP WHILE ALSO PROVIDING A SENSE OF TOKENIZED DIVERSITY EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW A LOT OF EAST ASIAN WOMEN ARE LIGHTSKINNED AND ARE OFTEN CONCEPTUALIZED AS THIN AND PALE AND DOEEYED IN THE WESTLUSE ITS SO STRANGE TO SEE THIS TREND OF WHITE WOMEN COOPTING EAST ASIAN CULTURE IN  LIKE ITS SO STRANGE TO SEE IT NOW BUT PEOPLE MY AGE CANT HELP BUT THINK OF THAT MEMORABLE TIME WHEN GWEN STEFANI WAS DOING THAT JUST ABOUT  YEARS AGO I MEAN WELL SHE WAS COOPTING SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE IN THE SCAO SHE WAS DOING EVERYONE LAUGHTERLUSE AND THEN THE S IT WAS EAST ASIAN CULTURE AND A LOT OF CHICANA CULTURE BUT ITS ALMOST LIKE THIS TREND IS CYCLICALCAO YEAH THIS FOR ME FEELS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC IMAGE OF ASIANNESS THATS BEING EXPORTED INTO THE COOLNESS OF WHITE NORMS SO ITS A DIFFERENT WOMAN THAN IT WAS IN THE S WHICH IS LIKE A DOLL ESSENTIALLY LIKE WITH YOU KNOW BIG LASHES AND THE BIG BRIGHT COLORS THIS IS A DIFFERENT WOMAN BUT THE ESSENCES OF WHAT IS COOL IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT FITS AGAIN INTO WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY DETERMINED AS DESIRABLE IN OUR CONTENTLUSE WHATS A TREND THAT YOU LIKE HAVENT SEEN YET BUT YOURE LIKE I WANT THIS TO POP IF YOU GOT TO INVENT A TREND AND PUT IT INTO ACTIONCAO INVENT A TREND OH MANLUSE YEAH I MEAN THIS IS NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO I MEAN YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING THAT STARTS A NATIONAL TRENDCAO LAUGHTERLUSE STAKES ARE HIGHCAO YOU KNOW WHAT LAUGHTER WHAT IF I WERE JUST LIKE

GUESS I MEAN I  THAT  ITS VERY TWISTED AND I HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WHERE PEOPLE KEPT SAYING THAT TO ME AND ACTUALLY A BIGGER REASON I DIDNT WANT TO GET MARRIED IS BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS AND I DIDNT WANT TO LIKE STRESS MYSELF OUT UNNECESSARILY AND ALL OF THATLUSE RIGHTHANDLER SO I MADE MY HUSBAND PLANNED THE WHOLE THING I TOLD HIM IF HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED IT WAS ON HIM

THE SEATING CHART NOW THAT SEAN DECIDED TO SHOW UPLUSE SO JENNIFER LOPEZ OBVIOUSLY FAMOUSLY A BRIDE IN BOTH HER REAL LIFE AND IN HER WORK  BUT SHES NOT JUST PLAYING THESE ROLESHANDLER NOLUSE SHE OFTEN PRODUCES THESE FILMSHANDLER YEAH EXACTLYLUSE SHOTGUN WEDDING IS A FILM THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN IN MOTION EITHER WHEN SHE WAS ENGAGED TO ALEX RODRIGUEZ OR ENGAGED TO BEN AFFLECK SO ON SOME LEVEL SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE PLANNING A WEDDING IN REAL LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS FILM WAS GOING TO BE IN PRODUCTION OR COMING OUT SO I FELT LIKE WITH SHOTGUN WEDDING THERE WAS SORT OF LIKE A SLY WINK FROM JENNIFER LOPEZ LIKE OK YEAH I KNOW WHAT IM DOING IN REAL LIFE I WONDER LIKE WHAT IS THE COMMUNICATION THROUGH THIS OVER LIKE WHAT IS SHE MAYBE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO US OR POSSIBLY WORKING OUT FOR HERSELF I MEAN YOU CANT KNOW RIGHT I DONT KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE LIKE ON THE PHONE TEXTING OR NOTHANDLER YES WERE TEXTING RIGHT NOW YEAHLUSE LAUGHTERHANDLER ILL ASK HER HONESTLY  RIGHT  I CANT KNOW BUT I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT  WHATS INTERESTING ABOUT SHOTGUN WEDDING IS AS  TO SORT OF COMPLETE THE FOUR MOVIES IT IS THE MOST SORT OF OPENLY ANTIWEDDINGINDUSTRIALCOMPLEX FILM ITS SORT OF ABOUT HOW ITS NOT WORTH IT IT TEARS PEOPLE APART ITS SILLY ITS VERY OPENLY LIKE AGAINST  EVEN HER CHARACTERS LIKE I NEVER WANTED ANY OF THIS YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK ON SOME LEVEL SHE MUST BE GRAPPLING WITH WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHY SHES SO COMPELLED TO HAVE THESE WEDDINGS OVER AND OVER TO HAVE THESE GIANT PRODUCTIONS OVER AND OVER IM SURE SHES LIKE ON A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL EXPLORING THAT SO I  YOU KNOW I THINK SHES GOT LEVELS LAUGHTERLUSE COMING UP WHAT JLO GETS OUT OF PERPETUAL BRIDEHOOD AND WHY WE NEED DIFFERENT KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT LOVE STAY WITH USYOU KNOW WEVE BEEN TALKING  I GOT MARRIED LAST YEAR IT SEEMS THAT YOU GOT MARRIED VERY RECENTLY AND I DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE WAS AS SOMEBODY WHO KIND OF TOOK A BACK SEAT TO THEIR WEDDING PLANNING BUT I CAN ATTEST THAT MUCH OF THE MODERN MESSAGING AROUND BEING A BRIDE WHICH REALLY TURNED ME OFF AND MADE WEDDING PLANNING MISERABLE FOR ME IS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE A PRINCESS OR A CELEBRITY FOR A DAYHANDLER OH GOD YEAHLUSE BUT JENNIFER LOPEZ IS ALREADY  SHES OBVIOUSLY ALREADY A CELEBRITYHANDLER YEAHLUSE BUT SHES ALSO ALREADY FUNCTIONALLY A PRINCESSHANDLER I WAS GOING TO SAY THATLUSE LIKE EVERY DAY LAUGHTER SHES VERY RICH AND SHE DOESNT NEED ONE AS A DISPLAY OF WEALTHHANDLER YEAHLUSE WHICH IS WHAT WEDDINGS DEFINITELY CAN BE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLEHANDLER ABSOLUTELYLUSE WHAT MIGHT A PERSON LIKE JLO GET OUT OF BEING A BRIDE LIKE ON SCREEN IN THAT WAY OR WANTING TO BE SEEN AS BEING A BRIDEHANDLER I REALLY THINK SHE SEES THESE WEDDINGS AS A DIRECT EXPRESSION OF LIKE LOVE AND WORTH WEVE ALL FOLLOWED JLO WEVE ALL WANTED HER TO BE HAPPYLUSE YESHANDLER YOU KNOW LIKE WERE ALL LIKE ROOTING FOR HERLUSE LAUGHTER YESHANDLER YOU KNOW AND I THINK  NOW SHE SEEMS LIKE SHES HAPPY WITH BEN AND THATS GREAT BUT IT TOOK HER YOU KNOW FOUR MARRIAGES TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND I REALLY THINK SHES LIKE AN OLDSCHOOL  LIKE SHE THINKS THAT A BIG WEDDING IS INCREDIBLY ROMANTICLUSE IT FEELS LIKE THE NATURAL END POINT OF THE IDEA THAT LIKE SUCCESS IS NOTHING UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TO SHARE IT WITHHANDLER YES WHICH IS MY FAVORITE BEYONCE QUOTE BY THE WAY WHERE SHE SAYS LIKE YOU KNOWLUSE LAUGHTERHANDLER I DONT REMEMBER THE EXACT QUOTE BUT SHE TALKS ABOUT LIKE WHATS THE POINT OF ANY OF THIS IF YOU DONT HAVE SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH AND I THINK ITS FASCINATING TO LOOK AT THESE MOVIES YOU KNOW JUXTAPOSED WITH HER LIFE AND THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS SHE LIKE ROILING OVER AT  IN THE MORNINGLAUGHTERLUSE I WONDER  YOU KNOW LOOKING PAST THE PERSONAL WHAT DOES BEING A PERPETUAL BRIDE MEAN FOR JLOS BRANDHANDLER MAYBE PART OF IT IS THAT SHE  TO SELL THE IDEA OF JLO  RIGHT  ITS LIKE THE PERSONALITY THE PERSONA THAT IS JLO I THINK SHES LIKE AN AMAZING ACTRESS WHO DOESNT OFTEN GET PARTS THAT ARE WORTHY OF HER LIKE THINK ABOUT HUSTLERS SHES SO GOOD IN HUSTLERSSOUNDBITE OF FILM HUSTLERSLOPEZ AS RAMONA WE GOT TO START THINKING LIKE THESE WALL STREET GUYS YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS COUNTRY THEY STOLE FROM EVERYBODY YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY COME INTO THE CLUB THATS STOLEN MONEYHANDLER SHE RARELY GETS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I WONDER IF LIKE SHES SORT OF LEANING HARDER INTO THIS ROMCOM JLO PERSONA AS SHE GETS OLDER BECAUSE SHE FEELS LIKE THATS WHERE SHES GOING TO GET THE MOST ROLES OR HAVE THE MOST SUCCESS AND PART OF THAT IS THIS CONCEPT LIKE YOURE SAYING OF BEING LIKE THIS TRADITIONAL  THE TRADITIONAL GIRLY BRIDE WHOS SELLING THAT FANTASY TO PEOPLE I DONT KNOW I HAVENT ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THATLUSE I HADNT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THAT WAY  LIKE SHES NOT GETTING THE AMY ADAMS PHONE CALLSHANDLER EXACTLY WHICH IS CRAZY I LOVE HER RANGE TOO YOU KNOW I LOVE JENNIFER  I LOVE HER IN ENOUGH I LOVE WHEN SHE  YOU KNOW I LOVE WHEN SHE GETS TO HOLD A GUN YOU KNOW I WANT TOLUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY LIKE MAYBE THATS THE NEXT ARTICLEHANDLER LAUGHTER WELL I SAID  IN SHOTGUN WEDDING I WAS LIKE THIS MARRIES THE TWO GENRES SHE HOLDS A GUN AND SHE GETS MARRIEDLUSE YOU KNOW WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS CONVERSATION PARSING JLOS ARTISTIC MESSAGING BUT SHES RELEASING THESE FILMS INTO AN ADORING MARKETPLACE SO WHAT ARE THESE FILMS TELLING US ABOUT OURSELVESHANDLER OH MY GOD I MEAN THIS IS WHERE I KIND OF  IT GETS A LITTLE DARK FOR ME I DO THINK ITS A LITTLE BIT MALEVOLENT TO MAKE THESE MOVIES OVER AND OVER LAUGHTERLUSE OOHHANDLER ESPECIALLY TO SELL THIS FANTASY OVER AND OVER TO LIKE A RAPIDLY DYING GLOBE WHERE YOU KNOW WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND I DO THINK THERES OBVIOUSLY A MASSIVE PLACE FOR ESCAPISM AND HUMOR AND JOY OF COURSE BUT LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT DOES IT TELL US ABOUT OURSELVES WHEN WE JUST WANT TO KEEP WATCHING THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHERE LIKE A BEAUTIFUL VERY WEALTHY WOMAN HAS LIKE AN AMAZING WEDDING TO THE MAN OF HER DREAMSAND LIKE I SAID ITS UNIMAGINATIVE AT BEST ITS CLAUSTROPHOBIC AT WORST LIKE ITS JUST  ITS WORTH QUESTIONING EVERYTHING AS I WAS WRITING THIS PIECE I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF YOU KNOW LIKE DAMN LIKE WE NEED TO   WE NEED SOME NEW MYTHS WE NEED SOME NEW STORIESLUSE IM LIKE WONDERING IM LIKE WHAT DOES THAT EVEN LOOK LIKE I MEAN MAYBE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW THE WOMAN WHO REFUSED A WEDDINGLAUGHTERLUSE FOR  YEARSHANDLER I DONT KNOWLUSE AND GETS HER HUSBAND TO PLAN THE ENTIRE THINGHANDLER I THINK A LOT ABOUT  THIS IS GOING TO GET LIKE A LITTLE MAYBE PRETENTIOUS BUT ELIF BATUMAN WROTE A PROFILE OF CELINE SCIAMMA IN THE NEW YORKER THAT I THINK ABOUTLUSE OH THE FILMMAKERHANDLER ALL THE TIME YES WHO DID PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF LIKE FEMALE STORYTELLING WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHEN A  THE TRADITIONAL ARC OF A MOVIE THE HEROS JOURNEY IS LIKE THE SAME EXACT AS THE ARC OF THE MALE ORGASMLUSE YESHANDLER AND SHE TALKED ABOUT STORYTELLING AS A CIRCLE  FEMALE STORYTELLING AS A CIRCLE SORT OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER AND GOING IN TO THE MIDDLE OF A STORY AND THATS THE STRUCTURE OF PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE ITS NOT A MALE ORGASM ITS A CIRCLE ITS LIKE CHANGED MY LIFE IT CHANGED MY BRAIN AND I THINK ITS POWERFUL TO REIMAGINE THIS TYPE OF THINGLUSE WELL I MEAN ITS INTERESTING BECAUSE I MEAN LITERALLY THE HEIGHT OF A STORY INHANDLER YEAHLUSE TRADITIONAL STORYTELLING IS CALLED THE CLIMAXHANDLER YEAHLUSE BUT I MEAN WHAT IS A WEDDING IF NOT THE  IN STORY TERMS THE MOST CLIMACTIC POINT OF A RELATIONSHIP AS WE TRADITIONALLY THINK ABOUT IT AND THE VEIL HAS BEEN I THINK MOVED FROM  REMOVED FROM MOST OF SOCIETYS EYES WITH REGARD TO THE FACT THAT MARRIAGES YOU KNOW DONT LAST FOREVER WE ALL KNOW THAT LIKE THE MEATY JUICY EXCITING PARTS OF A RELATIONSHIP ARE THE THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE LONG AFTER THAT CLIMACTIC POINT HAS BEEN REACHEDHANDLER EXACTLY AND I DO THINK YOU KNOW TO SORT OF PUT A FINER MORE ANNOYING POINT ON IT  I DO THINK THAT LIKE  THAT THESE MOVIES ABOUT TWO PEOPLE FINDING EACH OTHER HAVING THIS WEDDING AND THEN LIKE GOING OFF INTO THEIR LIVES ALONE  THIS IS JUST SORT OF REINFORCING THIS REALLY TOXIC IDEA OF AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISM THAT HAS ARGUABLY GOTTEN US TO THE PLACE THAT WERE AT NOW AT THE  SORT OF AT THE BEGINNING OF A CRUMBLING EMPIRE BECAUSE WERE NOT TAUGHT ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE WERE NOT TAUGHT  WE DONT WATCH STORIES WHERE THE ROMANCE IS ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AND HELPING EACH OTHER ITS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE BEING LIKE AND NOW WERE GOING TO BUY OUR HOUSE AND WERE GOING TO HAVE OUR KID AND WERE GOING TO LIVE OUR LITTLE LIFE ALONE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANLUSE YEAHHANDLER LIKE LOVE AND SUCCESS IS SO INDIVIDUALISTIC IN THESE FILMS AND WE NEED TO REIMAGINE I WISH THAT WE COULD MOVE IN THE CELINE SCIAMMA DIRECTION LIKE I WANT A JLOCELINE SCIAMMA COLLABLAUGHTERLUSE WELL RACHEL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH ME ABOUT THIS THIS WAS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE HOPED FORHANDLER OH MY GOD ME TOOLUSE IVE BEEN WAITING TO

TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO HERHARRIS YEAH SHE WAS POISONED TO DEATH AND FOR A LONG TIME THE STORY HAS BEEN THAT SHE SORT OF DIED OF BEING A CRAZY OLD LADY AND THIS IS LIKE  THIS IS THE STORY SORT OF I GREW UP HEARING AS A RESIDENT OF PALO ALTO THAT LIKELUSE OH WOWHARRIS JANE STANFORD DIED AND LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT SHE WAS POISONED BUT SHE PROBABLY DIED FROM LIKE BELIEVING IN GHOSTS AND LIKE BEING A WOMAN LAUGHTER AND MORE RECENTLY PEOPLE HAVE POKED AND PRODDED A LITTLE BIT AT THAT STORY AND IT FALLS APART VERY QUICKLY CAUSE SHE WAS POISONED NOT ONCE BUT TWICE  FIRST IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN AS SHE FLEES HER POISONING TO HAWAII WHERE SHE IS POISONED AGAIN TO DEATH SHE CALLS OUT HELP IM BEING POISONED TO DEATH YOU KNOW AS SHE DIES IN AGONYBUT THE GUY WHO REALLY CONTROLLED THE NARRATIVE OF THAT STORY WAS A GUY NAMED DAVID STARR JORDAN WHO WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY WHOD BEEN CHOSEN BY THE STANFORDS TO RUN THE SCHOOL AND AT THE TIME OF JANE STANFORDS POISONING THE TWO OF THEM JANE STANFORD AND DAVID STARR JORDAN HAD COME TO A REAL POINT OF CONFLICT WHERE SHE WAS ABOUT TO FIRE HIM AND HE WAS YOU KNOW WAITING MAYBE NOT WAITING SO LONG FOR HER TO DIE AND HE CHANGES THIS UNIVERSITY FROM A LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOL A PHILOSOPHY AND SPIRITUALISMDIRECTED INSTITUTION TO A SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION AND SCIENTIFIC FOR HIM AT THAT TIME MEANS FIRST AND FOREMOST MINING ENGINEERING BUT ALSO EUGENICSLUSE SO LIKE FOR HIM TO BE REALLY INTO EUGENICS REALLY INTO LIKE ETHNIC PURITY RACIST PSEUDOSCIENCE MINING ENGINEERING HES A CERTAIN TYPE OF GUY HIS PRESIDENCY AT THE UNIVERSITY CAN ALSO BE SEEN AS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A LOT OF THE INTELLIGENCE TESTING USED AND DEVELOPED AT STANFORD WHAT WERE SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE TESTS DEVELOPED AT STANFORDHARRIS YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO DAVID STARR JORDAN COMES FROM INDIANA UNIVERSITY THE STANFORDS COULDNT GET ANY OF THE IVY LEAGUE PRESIDENTS THAT THEY WANTED TO COME RUN THEIR NEW SCHOOL AND HE GOES BACK TO INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND PULLS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH HIM TO THIS NEW SCHOOL AND SO ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE PULLS FROM INDIANA TO STANFORD IS THIS GUY LEWIS TERMAN AND LEWIS TERMAN IS A FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST COMES TO LEAD THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION  IS PRESIDENT  AND ALSO A VERY PROMINENT EUGENICIST AND THE REAL PIONEER I THINK IS A GOOD WORD OF INTELLIGENCE TESTING IN THE UNITED STATESLUSE RIGHT TERMAN CREATES HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE TEST BASED OFF THIS FRENCH EXAM MADE TO CATCH KIDS FALLING BEHIND IN SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW  AND THE AUTHOR OF THE FRENCH EXAM EXPLICITLY WARNED AGAINST USING THAT AS AN IQ TESTHARRIS BUT THE REAL FIRST USE OF MASS IQ TESTS ON GROUPS OF PEOPLE COMES IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHERE TERMAN AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGISTS APPLY THESE TESTS TO INDUCTEES TO SOLDIERS WHO ARE HEADED TO THE FRONT LINES AND THIS IS A SOLUTION TO A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE EUGENICISTS WHICH WAS HOW DO YOU FIGHT A WAR IN THE TH CENTURY IN THE AGE OF GUNPOWDER WITHOUT LOSING YOUR BEST GENES AND THIS WAS A HUGE CONCERN FOR DAVID STARR JORDAN HE HAS THIS GREAT QUOTE ABOUT  YOU KNOW IN THE AGE OF GUNPOWDER THE CLOWN CAN SHOOT DOWN THE HERO ITS NO LONGER AN ADVANTAGE TO BE BRAVE IN WAR RIGHT WAR IS GOING TO HURT YOUR GENE POOL AND SO DAVID STARR JORDAN BECOMES A REAL PEACE ACTIVIST WHICH AGAIN IS KIND OF FUNNY  SO RACIST THAT HES ALUSE YEAHHARRIS PEACELOVING ANTIIMPERIALIST GOT TO PROTECT THE RACELUSE MMM LAUGHTER OK SO HOW DOES THIS TEST WORKHARRIS IF YOU SCORE AN A  RIGHT  IF YOURE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE THEYRE GOING TO TRY AND PULL YOU BACK FROM THE FRONT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO FIGHT ON THE FRONT LINES ARE THE C STUDENTS AND THE F STUDENTS MAYBE THEY SHOULDNT GET A GUN IN THE FRONT LINES LIKE MAYBE THATS NOT THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT WARS AND IT DIDNT REALLY CLICK FOR ME TILL I DID THE MATH AND UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE OF THE GENIUSES THAT TERMAN HAD TESTED WAS HIS SON FREDERICK TERMANLUSE RIGHTHARRIS AND FREDERICK TERMAN TURNS  AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AS THE DRAFT AGE GETS LOWERED FOR WORLD WAR I TO  AND SO FOR LEWIS TERMAN THIS WAS A PERSONAL PROBLEM FOR HIM RIGHTLUSE RIGHTHARRIS THESE WERE HIS OWN GENES HE WAS GOING TO WATCH HIS GENIUS SON GET KILLED IN THE WAR AND THAT WAS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR HIM IT WAS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR AMERICA BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THOSE GENIUSES TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT THE WARS OF THE FUTURELUSE THATS THE LINE OF THINKING RIGHTHARRIS THIS BECOMES A MAJOR SOLUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TH CENTURYLUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS GENIUS TESTING WORKED FEELS VERY CONNECTED TO SOME OF LIKE THE HIGHPRESSURE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT YOU REFERENCE LATER IN THE BOOK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN PALO ALTO DEAL WITH LIKE GOING TO PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLHARRIS YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND WE AS A WORLD ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH IS THE INEQUALITIES OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO OF  YEARS AGO AND THE QUESTION OF HOW COULD THOSE INEQUALITIES BE JUSTIFIED AND MAINTAINED IN A UNIFIED WORLD HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAINTAIN THESE GROUP INEQUALITIES INTO THE FUTURE AND PALO ALTOS ANSWER IS THAT THESE INEQUALITIES ARE NATURAL THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING AWAY THAT THERE IS A NATURAL HIERARCHY AMONG PEOPLELUSE YOU MAKE THE ARGUMENT IN YOUR BOOK THAT PALO ALTO IS A MICROCOSM OF ALL OF AMERICA AND YOU SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN YOUR BOOK OUTLINING THE HISTORY OF REDLINING IN PALO ALTO AND YOU KNOW THIS CITY IS PORTRAYED AS A FUTURISTIC TECH HUB BUT THAT PERCEPTION OF PALO ALTO CANT EXIST WITHOUT THE CREATION OF EAST PALO ALTO AS YOU ARGUE IT CAN YOU LAY OUT EAST PALO ALTOS CREATION AND HOW THAT REFLECTS THE CREATION OF GHETTOIZED AREAS AROUND THE UNITED STATESLUSE PALO ALTO IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS HISTORY AND YOU SEE IT WITH THE CREATION OF THE  HIGHWAY WHICH CURRENTLY SPLITS PALO ALTO AND EAST PALO ALTO THE LOCAL NAACP CALLED IT THE CONCRETE CURTAIN REFERRING TO THE IRON CURTAIN OF THE SOVIET UNIONLUSE RIGHT RIGHTHARRIS AND THE RESULT OF THAT WAS THAT EAST PALO ALTO GETS CHOKED OFF FROM THE RESOURCES THAT PALO ALTO BRINGS TO ITSELF IN THE FINAL QUARTER OF THE TH CENTURY AND THAT THE EAST PALO ALTO SCHOOL DISTRICT WITHERS AND IT EVENTUALLY COLLAPSES AND THAT YOU HAVE NO HIGH SCHOOL IN EAST PALO ALTO AND STUDENTS FROM EAST PALO ALTO GETTING SHIPPED  YOU KNOW BUSED  FORCIBLY BUSED  NOT JUST ACROSS TOWN TO PALO ALTO BUT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE PENINSULA THESE KIDS OF EAST PALO ALTO BECOME SYMBOLS FOR THE WHOLE NATION OF BAD KIDS IN THE MOVIE DANGEROUS MINDS WHICH PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SEEN  VERY POPULARLUSE MICHELLE PFEIFFER FAMOUSLY SITTING BACKWARD ON A CHAIR YEAH THAT WAS THE TIMEHARRIS ITS BASED ON A REAL BOOK THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS UNFORTUNATELY MY POSSE DONT DO HOMEWORKLUSE YEAHHARRIS WRITTEN BYLUSE THAT ONE HURT MY EYES TO READHARRIS YEAH WRITTEN BY A WHITE LADY TEACHER WHOSE  I BELIEVE IT WAS BELMONT WHICH IS UP THE PENINSULA BUT HER CLASS HER STUDENTS WERE FROM EAST PALO ALTO THEY WERE BUSED TO BELMONT EVERY MORNING CAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL CAUSE THEY SHUT DOWN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL EVENTUALLY BULLDOZED IT AND BUILT A SHOPPING MALL WHICH IS NOW RAVENSWOOD SHOPPING CENTER IN EAST PALO ALTO ITS WHERE THE IKEA IS AND THATS WHAT EAST PALO ALTO WAS TURNED INTO AND TO DO THAT YOU GOT TO SHIP THE KIDS OFF AND THIS WAS VERY DESTABILIZING TO A GENERATION OF CHILDREN INTENTIONALLY SOLUSE COMING UP  A CHILD GENIUS GROWS UP AND ENTERS THE WAR ROOMSOUNDBITE OF MUSICLUSE BEFORE I GET BACK INTO IT WITH MALCOLM IVE GOT SOME HISTORY FOR YOU AS YOU MAY KNOW STANFORD HAS A LOT OF POWERFUL ALUMNI BUT ONE OF ITS FIRST ALUMNI FROM THE VERY FIRST CLASS AT STANFORD WAS THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME PRESIDENT  HERBERT HOOVER HE HELPED SET UP POWERFUL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CAMPUS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AFTER WORLD WAR II THAT KID WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FRED TERMAN THE ONE WHOSE DAD SAVED HIM FROM THE DRAFT  WELL HE REVIVED AND CAPITALIZED ON THOSE HOOVER CONNECTIONS HE SETS UP THE UNIVERSITY TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF AEROSPACE COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS AND HIS RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS BECAME A MAGNET FOR FEDERAL RESEARCH FUNDS AND BY  MILITARY CONTRACTS PAID FOR MORE OF THE STANFORD PHYSICS DEPARTMENTS BILLS THAN THE UNIVERSITY DID AND ACCORDING TO HARRIS THAT LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR SILICON VALLEY SO THAT SENTIMENT THAT ALL OF YOUR TECHNOLOGY WAS FIRST DEVELOPED FOR THE MILITARY ITS NOT COMPLETELY UNFOUNDEDIN TALKING ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  SPECIFICALLY EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND SILICON VALLEY OR EVEN  MAYBE EVEN STANFORD SPECIFICALLY I WONDER LIKE WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MOST IMPACTFUL PRODUCT THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND STANFORDHARRIS WELL FOR ME WHEN I REALLY LOOKED AT THIS HISTORY IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE NUCLEAR MISSILE IS THE PRODUCT OF PALO ALTO THAT WE THINK OF THE NUCLEAR MISSILE AS LIKE YOU KNOW A ROCKET  BIG METAL ROCKET THAT WAS MADE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIALUSE RIGHTHARRIS BUT IF YOU THINK OF ITS COMPOSITION BY VALUE THE THINGS THAT REALLY ENABLED IT TO EXIST BESIDES THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY WERE THE TRANSISTORS  THE FIRST GENERATION OF SILICON TRANSISTORS ALL GO INTO MINUTEMAN I NUCLEAR MISSILES PERIOD  AND  AS WELL AS THE TESTING INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO CREATE THAT TECH IN THE FIRST PLACE AND MAKE SURE IT ALL WORKS WHICH IS COMING OUT OF HEWLETTPACKARD COMING OUT OF ALL THESE TESTING INSTRUMENT COMPANIESLUSE RIGHTHARRIS AND SO THE COMPOSITION BY VALUE OF THESE MISSILES WHICH AGAIN REALLY DOMINATED THE WORLD GEOPOLITICALLY NOT JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WHICH WE KNOW IT WAS THE BASIS FOR MISSILE KEYNESIANISM AND THE WHOLE POSTWAR AMERICAN ECONOMY BUT ALSO SET THE STAGE FOR AMERICAN DOMINATION IN THE COLD WAR PERIODLUSE TO CONTINUE OUR MARCH TOWARD THE PRESENT IM GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNET A GOOD PORTION OF EARLY INTERNET CULTURE IN THE S REVOLVED AROUND THIS IDEA THAT THE INTERNET WAS THIS RESOURCE THAT COULD EXPAND OUR WORLDS AND ALSO BRING US TOGETHER AND THERE WAS LIKE A POINT WHERE IT COULD SEEM LIKE THATS WHERE WE WERE HEADED ESPECIALLY LIKE WITH LIKE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIKE INTERNET HOBBYISTS AND LIKE TRYING TO FIND COOL WAYS TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER OR BUILD WEBSITES OR YOU KNOW A LOT OF DIY THINGS BUT INSTEAD WE HAVE ENDED UP WITH SOME OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AND BEEFY SURVEILLANCE TOOLS ON THE PLANET LAUGHTER BASED ON ALL THAT YOU SHARED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PALO ALTO AND THE US GOVERNMENT WAS IT ALWAYS INEVITABLE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE INTERNET WOULD ALWAYS BE USED FORHARRIS SO THE CONVENTIONAL HISTORY EVEN OF THE INTERNET ALWAYS STARTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH MILITARY FUNDING EVEN THE HIPPIESINVENTEDTHECOMPUTER STORY HAS TO ADMIT THAT LIKE ARPANET EXISTED AND THAT THE FOUNDATION FOR THE INTERNET ITSELF THE LITERAL NETWORKS THAT BECOME THE INTERNET WERE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS AND MILITARY PROJECTS ABOUT YOU KNOW IF WE GET BOMBED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HOW ARE WE GOING TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN OUR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND THAT BECOMES THE INTERNET AND THE HIPPIE LINE IS THAT LIKE YEAH THE MILITARY PAID FOR IT BUT IT WASNT REALLY A MILITARY TOOL THE MILITARY SORT OF GOT SCAMMED AND I THINK THATS A SELFSERVING KIND OF GOOFY NARRATIVEBUT THE HISTORY I THINK THAT GETS OVERLOOKED A LITTLE BIT AND REALLY WHERE I SEE THE CURRENT INTERNET EMERGING IS IN THE EARLY S UNDER THE GEORGE W BUSH ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I REALLY THINK ITS JOHN ASHCROFT WHO  PEOPLE MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER BUT HE WAS A REAL RIGHTWING SENATOR RIGHTWING STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MISSOURI WHO BECOMES GEORGE W BUSHS ATTORNEY GENERAL  FAMOUS FOR THE PATRIOT ACT AND FOR LEADING THE NEW ERA OF SURVEILLANCE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES BUT WHAT WE FORGET ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE WAS A REAL PROTECH GUY AND THAT THE TECH INDUSTRY LOVED JOHN ASHCROFT AND THAT SEEMS INCONGRUOUS NOW BECAUSE WE THINK OF THE TECH INDUSTRY AS LIKE LIBERAL CALIFORNIA WHATEVERLUSE RIGHTHARRIS BUT HE WAS PROCORPORATE AND SO THE FIRST THING HE DID WHEN HE GETS INTO THE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE IS HE DROPS THE ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT AND THIS WAS A REAL THREAT TO MICROSOFT AND HE SIGNALS TO ALL THESE FIRMS THAT HES NOT GOING TO ENFORCE ANTITRUST RULES ON TECH FIRMS HES NOT INTERESTED IN THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGIES LEND THEMSELVES TOWARDS HIGH LEVELS OF MARKET CONCENTRATION HE DOESNT WANT TO STOP THATINSTEAD WHAT HE WANTS TO BUILD AND WHAT HE DOES BUILD IS A BACK DOOR TO ALL THESE SYSTEMS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULDNT BE ABLE TO ACCESS OTHERWISE DIRECTLY AND SO THE GOVERNMENT IF ITS BUYING INFORMATION FROM INTERNET COMPANIES CAN GET A HOLD OF ALL SORTS OF USEFUL SURVEILLANCE INFORMATION THAT THEY COULDNT LEGALLY HARVEST DIRECTLY FROM AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THATS THE INTERNET THAT WE STILL HAVE THATS THE INTERNET THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN REVEALED THEN THATS THE INTERNET THAT  IT EXISTS AND ITS ONE WHERE THESE COMPANIES CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO AS LONG AS YOU HIT THE ACCEPT BUTTONLUSE RIGHT ON THE FINE PRINT THAT MANY PEOPLE DONT READHARRIS RIGHTLUSE BECAUSE ITS INCONVENIENTHARRIS BUT THATS NOT HOW LIKE MOST OF THE THINGS WORK IN OUR SOCIETY RIGHT LIKE THATS A PARTICULAR  SO IF YOU GO TO THE  YOU KNOW THE DELI COUNTER AT THE GROCERY STORE YOU DONT JUST LIKE HIT ACCEPT AND THEN GET WHATEVER MEAT THEY GIVE TO YOU ITS INSPECTED BY THE USDA RIGHT YOU CANT LIKE GET AROUND THAT WITH SOME AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND THE THING WERE BUYING STUFF FOR YOU CANT GO BUY AN UNSAFE CAR JUST BECAUSE YOU CLICK A LITTLE ACCEPT BUTTON THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT CONTROL THESE SYSTEMS AND WE COULD HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT ONE BUT WE GOT THIS ONE VERY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT HELPED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVADE RESTRICTIONS ON THE KIND OF INFORMATION IT COULD COLLECT AND SO WE HAVE AN INTERNET THAT IS A GIANT SPY APPARATUS BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAYLUSE THERE WAS A PROMISE THAT SILICON VALLEY AND THE PRODUCTS THAT IT PUT OUT WAS GOING TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES AND THAT HASNT REALLY BORNE OUT AND MANY OF THE BUSINESS PEOPLE INVESTORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOU KNOW THE FOUNDING AND OPERATIONS OF THESE COMPANIES STILL GOT ABSURDLY RICHHARRIS YEPLUSE AND NOW THE TECH SECTOR SEEMS TO BE KIND OF MELTING FROM CRYPTOS COLLAPSE TO ALL THE LAYOFFS IN THE INDUSTRY LIKE YOU KNOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT FACEBOOKS GOING TO LAY OFF  MORE EMPLOYEES TO THIS SILICON VALLEY BANK FAILURE I DONT KNOW AND IT  THE VIBE THAT IM GETTING IS THAT THE PUBLIC SEEMS TO ENJOY WATCHING TECH COMPANIES AND EXECS FAIL IS THIS LIKE THE BAD GUYS GETTING WHATS DUE IS THAT WHATS HAPPENING HERE THATS GOT PEOPLE SO FASCINATED WITH ALL OF THISHARRIS LOOKING AT IT HISTORICALLY THERE ARE THESE CYCLES IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE S AND HOW PEOPLE TREATED TECH EXECUTIVES THEN THEY CHASED DAVID PACKARD AROUND THE BAY STUDENT RADICALS ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE SAYING DAVID PACKARD CANT COME TO THE TOWN HE OWNS AND THEY USED TO CHANT PACKARD BEFORE CALLEY AS IN COMPARING HIM TO THE WORST WAR CRIMINAL OF THE VIETNAM ERA SO ITS NOT LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN MAD AT TECH LEADERS IN FACT THE PERIOD THAT WEVE HAD OF LIKE WORSHIP FOR THEM IS I THINK ALMOST UNUSUAL FOR HOW BIG IT IS AND HOW IT ISNT REALLY RELATED TO THEIR ACTUAL SKILL SET LIKE IF YOU COMPARE LIKE YOU KNOW ELON MUSK OR SAM ALTMAN OR SOME OF THESE GUYS TO THE GUYS WHO WERE LEADING TECH COMPANIES IN THE S WHO WERE LIKELUSE RIGHTHARRIS WORLDCLASS SCIENTISTS LIKE THESE GUYSLUSE THEY HAD LIKE  THEY HAD CHOPSHARRIS YEAHLUSE THEY HAD NOBEL PRIZES THINGS LIKE THATHARRIS YEAH AND THESE GUYS DONT AND REALLY WHAT THESE GUYS ARE GOOD AT IS GAMBLING RIGHT THEY HAVE THE NERVES TO GO GAMBLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OTHER PEOPLES MONEY AND THEN COME BACK AND DO IT AGAIN LIKE I DONT THINK I COULD DO THAT I DONT HAVE THE  YOU KNOW IM NOT GOING TO TAKE  BILLION FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND THEN THROW IT ON THE CRAPS TABLE LIKE NO WAY BUT SOMEONE LIKE ELON MUSK WILL YOU KNOW AND THATS WHAT THEIR VALUE TO THE WORLD ECONOMY IS IS THAT THEYRE WILLING TO MAKE THESE POTENTIALLY BIG PLAYS SO I DONT THINK WEVE TURNED AGAINST THESE PEOPLE NEARLY ENOUGHLUSE YOUVE TRACED THE HISTORY OF PALO ALTO FROM YOU KNOW ITS BEGINNING FROM ITS INCEPTION AND YOURE FROM THIS CITY YOUVE WATCHED SO MANY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES COME FROM THIS PLACE AND I MEAN YOU WERE EVEN  YOU WERE YOUNG BUT YOU WERE AROUND  YOU KNOW IN PALO ALTO AT THE TIME OF THE  OF EVEN LIKE THE DOTCOM BOOM AND BUST OF YOU KNOW THE LATE S EARLY S I WONDER ARE WE SEEING THE END OF THIS PROJECT ARE WE SEEING THE END OF PALO ALTO LIKE IS PALO ALTO OVERHARRIS NO WAY PALO ALTO IS AMERICA SOME PEOPLE SAY CALIFORNIA IS AMERICAS AMERICA AND I SAY IF CALIFORNIA IS AMERICAS AMERICA THEN PALO ALTO IS AMERICAS AMERICAS AMERICALUSE AMERICAS AMERICAS AMERICA YEAHHARRIS YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE HAVE THIS TWISTED THATS WHY I WANTED TO WRITE THIS BOOK AND REALLY PUT IT AT  PALO ALTO AT THE CORE OF MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY AT THE CORE OF THE AMERICAN TH CENTURY NOT AS JUST SOME PERIPHERAL LIKE ACCIDENT BUBBLE BECAUSE ITS NOT A BUBBLE THERES A BUBBLE MACHINE RIGHT THERES SOMETHING THAT KEEPS CREATING THESE CYCLES AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT MECHANISM IF WERE GOING TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT PALO ALTO PLAYS IN THE WORLD AND THE WORLD ITSELF AND SO NO YOU KNOW THE DEATH OF PALO ALTO HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED OVER AND OVER AND OVER IF YOU GO BACK TO THE S THEY WERE SAYING PALO ALTO IS OVER IF YOU GO BACK TO THE S THEYRE SAYING ITS OVER THE S ITS OVER  IT WAS  YOU KNOW THEY SAY ITS OVER CONSTANTLY AND AT THE SAME TIME ITS POSITION IN THE WORLD AND THE WORLD ECONOMY IS GROWING HUGELY EVEN SINCE I WROTE THIS BOOK YOU KNOW SINCE I SOLD IT IN EARLY  SILICON VALLEYS GROWNLUSE RIGHT I MEAN PART OF THE REASON WHY SILICON VALLEY BANK HAD ALL THE MONEY TO BUYHARRIS OH YEAHLUSE ALL OF THOSE BONDS IS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAD GROWN SO MUCH AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE COVID PANDEMICHARRIS THIS IS WHY I THINK ITS IMPORTANT TO GROUND THE HISTORY IN LIKE YOU KNOW  YEARS OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THE PRESENT STUFF IS JUST CHANGING SO FAST AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE PRESENT YOURE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF WIGGLING ALL SORTS OF PLACES AND IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT PAST HISTORIES OF SILICON VALLEY THEY REALLY ARE JUST REALLY WIGGLY IN THIS WAY OF JUST BEING FIXED TO THE PRESENT AND SO I TRIED TO LIKE REALLY ANCHOR

MARIELLE SEGARRA HERE REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A TEENAGER LIFE WAS SO EXCITING SO FULL OF POSSIBILITY AND ALSO SO DAMN PAINFUL YOU KNOW ONE DAY YOUR CRUSH STOPS BY YOUR LOCKER AND CHATS YOU UP AND THE NEXT HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND ONE DAY YOURE COMPLETELY IN SYNC WITH YOUR BEST FRIENDS AND THE NEXT THEYRE FREEZING YOU OUT AND YOU DONT KNOW WHY THE UPS AND DOWNS WOULD BE A LOT FOR ANYONE TO HANDLE BUT THATS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR TEENAGERS WHOSE BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING PSYCHOLOGIST LISA DAMOUR HAS DEDICATED HER CAREER TO WORKING WITH TEENSLISA DAMOUR I HAVE AN ENORMOUS PERSONAL FONDNESS FOR TEENAGERS I THINK IT IS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY AND PIVOTAL TIME OF LIFE AND WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT TEENAGERS IS THAT THEY ARE HEATSEEKING MISSILES FOR DISHONESTY THEY CAN SMELL IT OR DETECT IT AT A HUNDRED YARDS AND I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE RIGOR WITH WHICH THEY ENGAGE THE WORLD AND THEIR HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ADULTS AROUND THEM THAT I FIND INCREDIBLY COMPELLING BOTH INTELLECTUALLY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF MY OWN PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT I SORT OF FEEL LIKE IF YOU CAN GET IT RIGHT WITH A TEENAGER YOURE PROBABLY GETTING IT RIGHTSEGARRA SHE SAYS THANKFULLY THERE ARE TOOLS YOU CAN USE TO HELP THE TEENAGERS IN YOUR LIFE WORK THROUGH THEIR HARD MOMENTS AND BIG EMOTIONS ON THIS EPISODE OF LIFE KIT NPRS RACHEL MARTIN TALKS WITH DAMOUR ABOUT THOSE TOOLS AND ABOUT HER NEW BOOK THE EMOTIONAL LIVES OF TEENAGERS RAISING CONNECTED CAPABLE AND COMPASSIONATE ADOLESCENTS BY THE WAY EVEN IF YOURE NOT A PARENT OR A CAREGIVER TO A TEEN STAY TUNED CAUSE THERES A LOT IN HERE ABOUT HOW TO FEEL AND ALSO HOW TO SHOW UP FOR YOUR LOVED ONES REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGESOUNDBITE OF MUSICRACHEL MARTIN BYLINE CAN YOU HELP US EXPLAIN  OR HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING INSIDE A TEENAGERS BRAINDAMOUR THEYRE ACTUALLY UNDERGOING A PRETTY GRAND NEUROLOGICAL RENOVATION THAT KICKS OFF WITH PUBERTY AND OFTEN KICKS OFF EVEN BEFORE ADULTS CAN SEE THE OUTWARD SIGNS OF PUBERTY AND THAT OVER TIME WILL MAKE THEIR BRAIN MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT BUT ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES FOR BEING A TEENAGER AND BEING AROUND A TEENAGER IS THAT THEIR BRAIN DOES NOT UPGRADE ALL AT ONCE IT TENDS TO UPGRADE IN THE ORDER IN WHICH IT DEVELOPED INITIALLY WHICH IS FROM THE LOWERORDER REGIONS WHICH ARE HOUSED SORT OF ABOVE THE NECK TO THE HIGHERORDER REGIONS WHICH ARE HOUSED BEHIND THE FOREHEAD AND WHAT CAN BE VERY TRICKY FOR THE TEENAGER AND FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES THAT TEENAGER IS THAT THE EMOTION CENTERS ARE IN THE LOWER ORDER SECTIONS OF THE BRAIN AND THEY GET UPGRADED FIRST BEFORE THE PERSPECTIVE MAINTAINING SYSTEMS GET UPGRADED AND SOMARTIN THAT SEEMS LIKE A DESIGN FLAWDAMOUR LAUGHTER IT REALLY ISMARTIN NO OFFENSE GOD UNIVERSE MOTHER NATURE EVOLUTIONLAUGHTERDAMOUR MAYBE BETTER TO FLIP THAT ONE AROUND RIGHT AND SO WHAT IT MEANS IS THEY HAVE A JUNCTURE WHERE THEY HAVE VERY GAWKY BRAINS WHERE IF THEY BECOME STIRRED UP THEIR EMOTION CENTERS CAN READILY OUTMATCH THEIR PERSPECTIVEMAINTAINING SYSTEMS AND THEY CAN BECOME VERY UPSET AND VERY OVERWROUGHT OVER THINGS THAT EVEN AN HOUR LATER THE TEENAGER THEMSELVES WILL SAY YEAH I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LIKE I DONT KNOW WHY I BECAME SO UPSETMARTIN RIGHT IN THE COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WEVE HAD TO NOW TRY TO RECALIBRATE AFTER THE PANDEMIC WHAT PATTERNS DID YOU SEE EMERGE IN YOUR PATIENTSDAMOUR LETS TAKE A YEAROLD WHO I CARE FOR WHO HAD SOME ANXIETIES ABOUT SOCIALIZING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND THEN OF COURSE SPENT NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF VERY CUT OFF FROM SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SO NOW THIS YOUNG PERSON IS IN A POSITION WHERE HE CAN MOVE BACK INTO THE WORLD HE CAN START TO GO TO THINGS BE INVITED TO THINGS IS GETTING INVITED TO THINGS THAT HE WANTS TO GO TO BUT AS THE EVENT APPROACHES WHETHER ITS A GETTOGETHER WITH A FRIEND OR GOING TO A GAME HE BECOMES VERY VERY TENSE AND VERY VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING SO THE CLOSER IT GETS THE MORE LIKELY HE BECOMES TO SAY OK NEVER MIND IM JUST NOT GOING TO GO WHEN HE DOES THAT  AND THIS IS WHAT IVE WORKED WITH HIM ON  TWO THINGS HAPPEN AT ONCE FIRST HE INSTANTLY FEELS BETTER IT ACTUALLY DOES RELIEVE HIS ANXIETY AND SO THATMARTIN TO DECIDE NOT TO GODAMOUR TO DECIDE NOT TO GOMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR RIGHT AS SOON AS HE AVOIDS HE FEELS INSTANTLY BETTER AND WE CALL THAT A REINFORCING EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU DO IT YOU FEEL BETTER YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT WHATEVER HE IMAGINED ABOUT HOW FRIGHTENING THAT SOCIAL ACTIVITY WAS GOING TO BE GOES COMPLETELY UNCHALLENGED AND SO HIS BELIEF ABOUT HOW TENSE OR ANXIETYPROVOKING A SOCIAL SITUATION COULD BE REMAINS COMPLETELY AS IT WAS YOU KNOW WITHOUT ANY NEW INFORMATIONMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR SO WHAT WE WORK ON IS JUST WADING IN AND ILL  YOU KNOW ILL WORK WITH HIM ILL SAY CAN YOU GO TO THIS THING FOR  MINUTES AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND IF YOU REALLY  YOU KNOW IF YOURE HAVING A HARD TIME AFTER  MINUTES YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD LEAVE AT THAT POINT AND THEN WE WORK ON BUILDING UP HIS STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING ANXIETY WHEN IT COMES BUT THE GOAL AROUND AVOIDANCE IS ALWAYS TO HELP THE YOUNG PERSON  OR ACTUALLY REALLY A PERSON OF ANY AGE  SLOWLY FIND THEIR WAY BACK INMARTIN I LOVE THIS LINE THAT YOU WROTE IN THE BOOK READING SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WE BECAME AFRAID OF BEING UNHAPPYTHATS JUST  NOT JUST FOR TEENAGERS THATS FOR ALL OF US ALL THE PEOPLE AT ALL THE STAGES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THIS IDEA THAT WE CANT BE IN THAT PLACE OF GREAT SADNESS THAT TO BE MENTALLY HEALTHY YOU HAVE TO SORT OF BE THIS KIND OF ENLIGHTENED SOUL WHO DOESNT LET EMOTIONS GET THE BETTER OF YOU AND IT WAS REASSURING TO ME ANYWAY TO READ THAT IT IS OK  NOT ONLY OK BUT A SIGN OF SOLID MENTAL HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THOSE DARKER SPACES ITS JUST GIVING YOURSELF AND YOUR KIDS THE TOOLS TO CLIMB OUTDAMOUR ABSOLUTELY AND I WILL SAY WE DO HAVE AN ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS REAL AND THAT IS GETTING A LOT OF MUCHDESERVED COVERAGE BUT I THINK THAT HAS IN FACT EXACERBATED PARENTS ANXIETIES ABOUT THEIR KIDS OWN DISTRESS BECAUSE WITH ALL OF THOSE HEADLINES THAT ARE TELLING A TRUE STORY I THINK A LOT OF PARENTS ARE LOOKING AT THEIR PARTICULAR YEAROLD WHO IS HAVING A MELTDOWN IN THEIR PARTICULAR KITCHEN AND THINKING HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS NORMAL ADOLESCENCE AND NOT A MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR AND SO MY AIM IN WORKING ON  WORKING THROUGH THIS BOOK WAS TO REALLY GIVE PARENTS AND ADULTS AROUND TEENAGERS A WAY TO TEASE THOSE APART AND USUALLY THE WAY TO KNOW IS IF THE FEELING MAKES SENSE THATS A SIGN THAT THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF THE TEENAGER HANDLES IT IN WAYS THAT BRING RELIEF AND DO NO HARM YOU CAN PROBABLY ALSO FEEL REASSURED THAT YOURE LOOKING AT TYPICAL DISTRESS WHEREAS IF A TEENAGERS FEELINGS ARE WAY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE EVENT OR THEY HANDLE THE FEELINGS IN WAYS THAT ARE COSTLY SUCH AS SMOKING A LOT OF MARIJUANA OR BEING REALLY HARD ON THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM OR GETTING ONLINE AND STIRRING UP ALL SORTS OF YOU KNOW TROUBLE OVER THERE THATS WHEN WE WANT TO TUNE IN AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PERSON IS GETTING ALL THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVEMARTIN SO MUCH OF OUR TEENAGERS EMOTIONAL STRUGGLES ARE ROOTED IN LOW SELFESTEEM AND YOU ADDRESS THIS YOU DONT WANT TO GIVE EVERYONE A TROPHY RIGHT WEVE ALL KIND OF COLLECTIVELY DECIDED THAT THATS NOT AWESOME ALL THE TIME BUT WHEN PARENTS HEAR THEIR KIDS TALKING THIS REALLY DEFEATIST WAY  RIGHT  IM NOT GOOD ENOUGH NO ONE LIKES ME  ITS NOT ALWAYS LOGICAL OR ROOTED IN TRUTH SO HOW DO YOU GET THEM OUT OF THATDAMOUR REASSURANCE DOES NOT WORK NEARLY AS WELL AS WE WOULD WANT IT TO AND I THINK A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE FOUND THAT WHEN THEY TRY TO COUNTER WHAT WED SOMETIMES CALL NEGATIVE SELFTALK HERE ARE A FEW STRATEGIES TO TRY INSTEAD SOMETIMES IT CAN BE HUGELY HELPFUL JUST TO EMPATHIZE WITH HOW THE KID FEELS TO SAY YOU KNOW NOW I KNOW THATS NOT TRUE YOU KNOW THATS NOT TRUE BUT IT MUST BE AWFUL TO FEEL THAT WAY RIGHT JUST TO REST WITH THEM IN THAT FEELING CAN BE VERY POWERFULANOTHER THING WE CAN SAY IS ALL RIGHT LIKE YOU HAD A ROUGH GOAROUND YOU KNOW THAT INTERACTION WITH YOUR FRIEND OR WHATEVER HAPPENED AT SCHOOL AND I HEAR WHAT YOURE SAYING THAT YOU FEEL REALLY DOWN ON YOURSELF WHY DONT WE CALL THAT YOUR FIRST REACTION AND WHY DONT WE SEE IF A SECOND REACTION COMES ALONG THATS A DIFFERENT ONE SO NOT GETTING TOO STUCK ON IT AND THE LAST THING  AND THIS IS MORE PLAYFUL IT WONT WORK FOR EVERY PARENT AND CHILD  IS IF A TEENAGERS TALKING BADLY ABOUT THEMSELVES THE PARENT CAN SAY WHOA WHOA WHOA I LOVE YOU NOBODY GETS TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE I LOVE THAT WAY NOT EVEN THEMSELVESMARTIN OH I LIKE THATDAMOUR SO WE GOT TO FIND ANOTHER WAYMARTIN YEAH THERE ARE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT KIDS SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD WALK THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT THEORETICAL CASE STUDIES RIGHT IF YOUVE GOT A CHILD WHO IS VERY EMOTIONALLY FLUENT AND CAN TALK DIRECTLY ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONS BUT THE PROBLEM THEN BECOMES WHEN THAT CHILD OVER PROCESSES AND THAT ITSELF BECOMES THE PROBLEM THEY CANT BREAK OUT OF THAT MENTAL GYMNASTICS WHAT DO YOU DODAMOUR SO IF WE SEE THAT IN A YOUNG PERSON WE ACTUALLY WANT TO SHIFT GEARS AND SHIFT AWAY FROM THEM TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING AND ACTUALLY DEEPENING THEIR DISTRESS TOWARDS A STRATEGY THAT MAY HELP BRING THAT FEELING DOWN TO SIZE A BIT OR HELP THE YOUNG PERSON FEEL MORE IN CONTROL SO THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN WORK ACTUALLY IS A BRIEF DISTRACTION JUST TAKING ONES MIND OFF OF IT A LITTLE BIT AND THE WAY TO INTRODUCE THIS TO A TEENAGER IN A WAY THAT WONT FEEL DISMISSIVE OR MINIMIZING IS TO SAY YOU KNOW LOOK THE MORE WERE TALKING THE WORSE YOU FEEL SO LETS DO THIS  WHY DONT WE PUSH PAUSE WHY DONT YOU OR WE GO DO SOMETHING FUN OR SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER LETS GO WATCH YOU KNOW A RERUN OR GO OUTSIDE AND THEN LETS COME BACK TO THIS TOMORROW AND SEE WHERE YOU ARETHAT KIND OF REDIRECTION IS OFTEN SUFFICIENT TO SOLVE A LOT OF THE PROBLEM ITS VERY COMMON THAT KIDS COME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND THEYRE LIKE YEAH I DONT KNOW I FEEL FINE IT DOESNT SEEM AS BIG TODAY RIGHT FANTASTIC YOU SOLVED IT JUST BY TAKING A BREAKMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I OFTEN THINK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOM FOR THE FIRST TIME ALMOST  YEARS AGO I WAS ENORMOUSLY PREGNANT WITH MY OLDER DAUGHTER AND I WAS SITTING WITH A SENIOR COLLEAGUE WHO I THINK  WE KNEW WE WOULDNT SEE EACH OTHER UNTIL AFTER I HAD HAD MY DAUGHTER AND SO THE MEETING ENDED AND SHE SAID HEY DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU HOW PSYCHOLOGISTS MESS UP THEIR KIDS AND I SAID YES ACTUALLY I DO AND SHE SAID THEY TALK ABOUT FEELINGS TOO MUCH THAT WHEN THEIR CHILD IS HAVING A MELTDOWN THEY CAN ACTUALLY JUST EXCAVATE EXCAVATE EXCAVATE AND SHE SAID THERE COMES A POINT WHERE ITS REALLY HELPFUL TO SAY YOU KNOW YOURE PRETTY UPSET WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE ITS NOT HELPING WHAT WOULD HELP YOU FEEL BETTER  AND TO REALLY MOVE INTO COMFORTS OR DISTRACTIONS OR PROBLEM SOLVING AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND EQUALLY VALUABLE WAY TO HELP MANAGE FEELINGSMARTIN WHAT ABOUT THE KID WHO DOESNT WANT TO OPEN UP MAYBE DOESNT HAVE THE LANGUAGE OR JUST DOESNT WANT TO DOESNT WANT TO SHARE IN THAT WAY HOW DO YOU CREATE SAFE SPACES WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE CONTROLDAMOUR WHEN TEENS MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TALK BUT DONT ANSWER QUESTIONS VERY READILY RIGHT  MAYBE AT DINNER THE PARENTS ARE ASKING ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND THE KID IS GIVING THEM NOTHING RIGHT SCHOOL WAS FINE NOTHING HAPPENEDMARTIN RIGHTDAMOUR WHAT I DISCOVERED WHILE WORKING ON THE BOOK IS THAT ITS VERY VERY COMMON FAR MORE COMMON THAN I EVER UNDERSTOOD FOR TEENAGERS WHO WERE ENTIRELY TIGHTLIPPED FOR THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON AND EVENING TO SHOW UP IN THEIR PARENT OR PARENTS ROOM AT NIGHT WHEN THE PARENTS ARE TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP AND SUDDENLY BE CHATTER BOXES AND SUDDENLYMARTIN I FEEL THIS SO MUCH I FEEL THIS SO MUCHDAMOUR ITS SO TRUEMARTIN IM LIKE SO DESPERATE TO GO TO SLEEPDAMOUR YOURE SO DESPERATEMARTIN AND PITTERPATTER PITTERPATTER PITTERPATTERDAMOUR AND THEN HERE THEY ARE SO I WAS THINKING LIKE WELL WHY DO THEY DO THIS AND THEN I THOUGHT OK THIS IS A BRILLIANT ADOLESCENT SOLUTION TO THE FACT THAT THEY BOTH WANT TO BE AUTONOMOUS AND THEY WANT TO CONNECT WITH THEIR PARENT OR PARENTS AND SO BY WAITING UNTIL WERE IN BED AND TRYING TO SHUT IT DOWN FOR THE NIGHT THEY GAIN CONTROL LIKE YOU SAY SO IF THERES GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION THEYRE THE ONE WHO INITIATES IT BECAUSE THEY COME ON IN THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES SETTING THE AGENDA BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT WE ARE NOT INTRODUCING NEW TOPICS OR ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS IVE HAD TEENAGERS SAY THIS TO ME THEYVE SAID OH MY PARENTS ARE THE BEST AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT BECAUSE THEY DONT ASK SO MANY QUESTIONS AND IM THINKING RIGHT BECAUSE THEYRE TRYING TO GO TO SLEEPMARTIN RIGHTDAMOUR AND THEN WHEN THEY WANT THE CONVERSATION TO END ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY ALL RIGHT YOU GUYS ILL LET YOU GO TO SLEEP AND THEN THEYRE OUT THE DOORMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR AND SO ITS A BEAUTIFUL SOLUTIONMARTIN THEY CAN WALK AWAY WHEN THEYRE DONE YEAHDAMOUR YEAH SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW NOT ALL KIDS ARE GOING TO DO THIS BUT THE LESSON IS THE SAME WHICH IS WE NEED TO BE AMENABLE TO THEIR TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT WE CANT ALWAYS EXPECT THE TEENAGERS ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT ITMARTIN BUT DONT YOU HAVE AN ANECDOTE IN THE BOOK WHERE YOU FOUND GOOD CONVERSATION HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRAP YOUR CHILD IN THE CAR AND YOURE DRIVING AND THEY CANT ESCAPEDAMOUR I WOULDNT SAY SO MUCH GOOD CONVERSATION BUT I CAN GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE THAT WAY OR I CAN GET A WORD IN THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE NEED TO HAVE HARDER CONVERSATIONS OR DELICATE CONVERSATIONS AND IT IS DEFINITELY MY EXPERIENCE THAT WAITING UNTIL WERE IN THE CAR WHEN EVERYBODYS EYES ARE FRONT AND NOBODY HAS TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND EVEN WAITING UNTIL WERE THREE MINUTES FROM THE HOUSE SO MY KID KNOWS IT CANNOT GO ON VERY LONG IS ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT CAN WORKBUT THE OTHER THING RACHEL THAT I REALLY WANT TO BRING ACROSS IS THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS THAT KIDS EXPRESS FEELINGS THAT ARE NONVERBAL KIDS USE MUSIC VERY POWERFULLY TO DO IT THEYLL OFTEN LISTEN TO MUSIC THAT MATCHES THEIR MOOD TO KIND OF CATALYZE THE EXPRESSION MOST TEENAGERS I KNOW HAVE SAD AND ANGRY PLAYLISTS THAT THEY TURN TO WHEN THEY NEED TO GET A FEELING OUT AS THEY SAY THEY WILL BE PHYSICAL THEYLL GO OUTSIDE THEYLL YOU KNOW KICK A SOCCER BALL THEYLL YOU KNOW SMASH VOLLEYBALLS LIKE THEYLL DO THINGS LIKE THAT TO GET  TO DISCHARGE SOME OF THEIR DISTRESS OR THEY MAKE ART OR YOU KNOW ANY VARIETY OF THINGS AND I THINK WE CAN SO READILY PRIVILEGE THE VERBAL EXPRESSION OF A FEELING AND REALLY NOT VALUE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT KIDS EXPRESS EMOTIONS THAT GIVES THEM TREMENDOUS RELIEF AND COMES AT NO COSTMARTIN IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO REMEMBER THAT ITS NOT ABOUT US RIGHT LIKE IT CAN FEEL SO PERSONAL ESPECIALLY IF YOUR ADOLESCENT ACTS IN A WAY THAT ENDS UP FEELING REALLY HURTFUL TO YOUDAMOUR YEAH YEAHMARTIN BUT PART OF THIS JOURNEY IS WE AS ADULTS HAVE TO KIND OF STEP UP AND MODEL FOR OUR KIDS HOW TO MANAGE OUR OWN EMOTIONSDAMOUR ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK  AS THE MOTHER OF TWO TEENAGERS I AM VERY EMPATHIC THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU CAN FEEL LIKE ADOLESCENCE IS SOMETHING YOUR KID IS DOING TO YOUMARTIN LAUGHTER RIGHTDAMOUR WHAT WE WANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT ADOLESCENCE IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY DEMANDING DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE THAT YOUR KID IS GOING THROUGH AND THAT AS THE PARENT AROUND WERE ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND WE GET PULLED IN IN WAYS THAT DONT ALWAYS MAKE SENSE TO US AND WE DO WANT TO BE HELPFUL AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS WE CAN BE HELPFUL IS HAVING A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON OUR OWN EMOTIONS  NOT ALL THE TIME EVERY DAY BUT MOST OF THE TIME AND THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS THAT WHEN TEENAGERS ARE HAVING THEIR VERY POWERFUL FEELINGS ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS WE CAN GIVE THEM IS TO BE A STEADY PRESENCE FOR THEM TO USE OUR OFTENWORDLESS ACTIVITY AROUND THEM TO COMMUNICATE THAT WE ARE NOT ALARMED BY THEIR FEELINGS WE DO NOT THINK THEY NEED TO BE UNDULY ALARMED BY THEIR FEELINGS WE CAN ENGAGE WITHOUT JUMPING INTO ACTION HUGELY REASSURING FOR TEENAGERSMARTIN THAT ONE SPEAKS TO ME  ENGAGE WITHOUT JUMPING INTO ACTION I KIND OF COME AT THINGS IN THIS VERY FIXIT MENTALITY LIKE WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO FIX THIS SITUATION AND THAT IS OFTEN NOT THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTIONDAMOUR IT OFTEN ISNT AND ITS OFTEN NOT WHAT TEENAGERS ARE LOOKING FOR THEY OFTEN  WHEN THEY BRING THEIR TROUBLES TO US I WOULD SAY THE TWO THINGS THEY WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD ARE CURIOSITY  JUST FOR US TO BE CURIOUS LEARN MORE ABOUT WHATS BOTHERING THEM  AND THEN EMPATHY THOSE GO VERY FAR THE OTHER REASON WE WANT TO HAVE A HANDLE ON OUR EMOTIONS IS THAT OUR KIDS ARE WATCHING US AND THEYRE WATCHING HOW WE HANDLE OUR OWN DISTRESS AND WERE REALLY SERVING AS MODELS IN THATMARTIN YEAHDAMOUR SO IF WE HAVE A VERY BAD DAY  WHICH OF COURSE WERE GOING TO HAVE VERY BAD DAYS  AND WE COME IN THE HOUSE AND WERE LIKE OH MY GOSH I HAD THE WORST DAY EVER LIKE WHERE IS THE WINE  RIGHT  WERE SENDING A MESSAGEMARTIN I DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT IVE NEVER SAID THATDAMOUR OH GOODLAUGHTERDAMOUR BUT IF WE SAY OH MY GOSH I HAD THE WORST DAY EVER LIKE I NEED TO GO FOR A WALK IF ANYONE WANTS TO COME WITH ME ILL TAKE COMPANY WERE SENDING ANOTHER KIND OF MESSAGE AND THATS WHY WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF HOW WE HANDLE OURSELVES IN FRONT OF OUR KIDS AROUND OUR FEELINGS BOTH BECAUSE WE HELP TO CREATE THE EMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE THAT THEY ARE LIVING WITHIN AND ALSO BECAUSE WERE TEACHING ALL THE TIME AND WE WANT TO BE TEACHING THEM THAT DISTRESS IS A DONE DEAL WE DONT ACTUALLY GET TOO ANXIOUS ABOUT THAT WHAT WE REALLY FOCUS ON IS MANAGING IT IN WAYS THAT ARE GOING TO REALLY SUSTAIN US OVER TIMESOUNDBITE OF GORDON JOHNSSON AND JOHN BROOKLYNS WE FLOAT REMOTEMARTIN THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE EMOTIONAL LIVES OF

KIT  WITH TOOLS TO HELP YOU GET IT TOGETHERSOUNDBITE OF MUSICSEGARRA HEY EVERYBODY MARIELLE SEGARRA HERE ABOUT  YEARS AGO JARED WALKER SAYS HE AND HIS WIFE WERE SITTING AT HOME WHEN SHE GOT A PHONE CALL IT WAS BAD NEWSJARED WALKER HER AUNT HAD PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER AND THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER I GOT A PHONE CALL MY COUSIN HAD GONE INTO LABOR SEVEN WEEKS PREMATURE BABY NEEDED A HEART SURGERY TO LIVE AND BOTH FAMILIES KIND OF HIT WITH THESE MEDICAL CRISES AND I REMEMBER HEARING CONVERSATIONS LIKE HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR ITSEGARRA THAT WAS JAREDS FIRST REAL RUNIN WITH THE US HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THE FIRST TIME HE REALIZED THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE US A MEDICAL CRISIS IS ALSO A FINANCIAL CRISIS A FEW YEARS LATER HE STARTED DOLLAR FOR NOW A NATIONAL NONPROFIT THAT HELPS PEOPLE ELIMINATE THEIR MEDICAL BILLS AND HE SAYS IF YOURE STARING AT A BIG TERRIFYING MEDICAL BILL FIRST OF ALL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT ALONE THERES AN ESTIMATED  BILLION OF OUTSTANDING MEDICAL DEBT IN AMERICAWALKER THERES NO SHAME IN THIS THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF SOME FAILING ON YOUR PART YOU DIDNT CHOOSE TO HAVE A MEDICAL CRISIS THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE BROKEN SYSTEM AND NOT YOUSEGARRA BUT ALSO THERES A WELLKEPT SECRET ABOUT THE ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNTS ON YOUR MEDICAL BILLSWALKER THEYRE FAKE NUMBERS THEY CAN BE NEGOTIATEDSEGARRA AND MANY HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO LOWER YOUR BILL OR GET RID OF IT ENTIRELY IF YOUR INCOME FALLS BELOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT MEDICAL BILLS ALWAYS SEEM URGENT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAY DUE UPON RECEIPT BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME BEFORE THEYRE SENT TO COLLECTIONS OR THEY AFFECT YOUR CREDITWALKER AND THERE IS NO LIKE SENSE OF URGENCY  YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS NOW YOU HAVE TIME YOU CAN TAKE A DEEP BREATH GET A PLAN AND GO FROM THERESEGARRA ON TODAYS EPISODE JARED AND I ARE GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE THAT PLAN WELL TALK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HOW TO CHECK YOUR BILL FOR ERRORS AND HOW TO NEGOTIATE AND WE MIGHT JUST SAVE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARSSOUNDBITE OF MUSICSEGARRA SO LETS SAY YOU GET A BIG MEDICAL BILL IN THE MAIL  I DONT KNOW   FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD DONE WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DOWALKER FIRST THING I WOULD TELL PEOPLE TO DO IS SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE AND CHARITY CARE IS A FEDERAL LAW THAT WENT INTO EFFECT WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ITS LIKE THE BESTKEPT SECRET OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT REQUIRES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS TO HAVE THESE POLICIES THEY HAVE TO PROVE TO THE IRS THAT THEYRE PROVIDING COMMUNITY BENEFIT SO TO KEEP THEIR NONPROFIT STATUS THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE FREE OR REDUCED CARE TO PATIENTS WITHIN A CERTAIN INCOME RANGE TYPICALLY A POLICY WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE IF YOURE AT OR BELOW YOU KNOW  OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE THEN YOURE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE CARE OR REDUCED CARE SO NO   SEE IF YOURE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCESEGARRA WOW THAT IS A BIG SECRET NOBODY TELLS YOU THAT WHEN THEY SEND YOU THE BILLWALKER ABSOLUTELY NOT I MEAN YOU CAN CALL EVEN THE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE BILL SO ITS LIKE OH CALL THIS NUMBER IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE PAYING IT ITS LIKE YOUD THINK THAT THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THE CHARITY CARE DEPARTMENT BUT TYPICALLY ITS LIKE WELL PUT YOU ON A PAYMENT PLAN YOU KNOW AND NOTHING IS STANDARDIZED ABOUT THIS PROCESS SO YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE AT ONE HOSPITAL DOWN THE STREET AND NOT ELIGIBLE AT THE NEXT SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HOSPITAL DECIDES IS THEIR CUTOFF FOR INCOME IS DIFFERENT HOSPITAL TO HOSPITAL SOMETIMES THERE ARE STATE LAWS THAT BULK THIS UP AND HAVE MINIMUMS AND YOU KNOW BETTER PROTECTIONS BUT TYPICALLY IT IS DIFFERENT ACROSS THE BOARDSEGARRA OK SO THATS FOR NONPROFIT HOSPITALS DOES IT ALSO APPLY TO FORPROFITSWALKER SO THE FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT BUT MOST EVERY FORPROFIT HOSPITAL WILL ALSO HAVE A CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY ITS JUST THERES NOT A FEDERAL LAW SAYING THAT THEY HAVE TO SO THEYRE TYPICALLY A LITTLE LESS GENEROUS AND  BUT THEY  A LOT OF THEM STILL HAVE THEM AND YOU CAN APPLY WEVE GOTTEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WAIVED FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AT FORPROFIT HOSPITALS ITS JUST A LITTLE TOUGHER SOMETIMESSEGARRA OK SO IF I WANTED TO SEE IF I WAS ELIGIBLE WHERE WOULD I STARTWALKER WELL THERES TWO OPTIONS ONE YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST GOOGLE YOUR HOSPITAL NAME PLUS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TYPICALLY ITS THE FIRST LINK SO IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE THEN IT JUST BECOMES  FIND THE APPLICATION SO FIND THE APPLICATION TYPICALLY ITS LIKE TWO PAGES WHO ARE YOU WHO DO YOU LIVE WITH WHERE DO YOU WORK HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE AND ITS LIKE THEN PROVE IT PROOF OF INCOME  PAY STUBS TAX RETURN ALL THAT SO YOU FILL ALL THAT OUT AND SUBMIT IT TO THE HOSPITAL THROUGH WHATEVER WACKY WAY THEY DO THAT  TYPICALLY THROUGH FAX OR MAIL OR WHATEVER  AND SUBMIT IT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN YOU CAN WAIT A COUPLE WEEKS AND THEN JUST CHECK IN AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE I TYPICALLY BOTHER THEM A LOT ABOUT ITSEGARRA SO IF YOU DONT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER OPTIONSWALKER SO IT ALWAYS ASKS FOR AN ITEMIZED BILL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ANNOYING THAT WE HAVE TO DO BUT WE CALL THE HOSPITAL I HAVE TO ASK FOR THAT ITEMIZED BILL WHICH WILL HAVE ALL THE PROCEDURES YOU HAD DONE AND THEN THEY WILL HAVE A CPT CODE ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THAT AND A CPT CODE IS JUST THE CODE ASSOCIATED WITH WHATEVER HAPPENED AT THE HOSPITAL SO A CERTAIN SCAN THAT YOU HAVE OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE ITLL HAVE THIS IS THE CODE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND YOU CAN LOOK UP WHAT THOSE ARE AND SEE IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY  IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED CAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOULL GET A BILL AND ITLL SAY OH YOU GOT THIS SCAN AND IT NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENEDSEGARRA YEAH I REMEMBER ACTUALLY HAVING SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN WHEN I WENT TO GET A HEARING TEST AND I GOT THE BILL BACK AND IT SAID THAT I HAD SOME KIND OF EAR PROCEDURE DONE THAT I DEFINITELY DIDNT I LOOKED IT UP I DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANT AT FIRST BUT I LOOKED IT UP AND THEN I ASKED MY BROTHER  BECAUSE HES A DOCTOR  JUST TO CONFIRM AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD KNOW YOU HAD DONE CAUSE IT WAS KIND OF INVASIVE AND YEAH SO I CALLED THE BILLING OFFICE AND THEY WERE LIKE OH NO THATS ALWAYS DONE WITH A HEARING TEST AND I WAS LIKE NO WELL IT WASNT YOU KNOWWALKER YEAH YEAHSEGARRA THEY ENDED UP WIPING THAT  OFF OF THE BILLWALKER GOOD ON YOU YEAH NO THAT IS SUPER COMMON THAT YOU WOULD GET CHARGED FOR SOMETHING THAT DIDNT HAPPENSEGARRA ITS KIND OF WILD TO BE GETTING INTO ALL THIS THE FACT THAT THIS IS HOW OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS THAT ITS ON THE PATIENT THEN TO LOOK AT THE BILL AND BE DIGGING THROUGH THE WEEDS LIKE THISWALKER YEAH IT IS WILD AND ITS LIKE THERES SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE PATIENT TO FIND LIKE  WE SHOULDNT HAVE TO FACTCHECK THE HOSPITALS FOR THESE THINGS BUT WE DO AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GO TO SCHOOL FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND TAKE TONS OF TESTS JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE CODES MEAN AND WERE LIKE OVER HERE YOU KNOW GOOGLING ON  YOU KNOW GETTING ON TIKTOK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIGURE OUT YOUR MEDICAL BILLS ITS INSANESEGARRA ALL RIGHT SO YOUVE TRIED ALL THESE THINGS LETS SAY THAT YOURE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE AND YOUR BILL IS TECHNICALLY CORRECT WHAT CAN YOU DOWALKER YOU CAN NEGOTIATE SO THE  I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THE NUMBERS ARE FAKE THEY DONT MATTER LIKE IT CAN ALWAYS BE LOWERED SO YOU CAN CALL THE HOSPITAL AND THE FIRST THING I ASK IS WHATS THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT LIKE WHAT WILL YOU TAKE RIGHT NOW IF I CAN CLOSE OUT THIS ACCOUNT TYPICALLY WE CAN GET  TO  OFF JUST BY ASKING THAT IF I PAY YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT CAN I GET LOWERED OFF THIS BILLSEGARRA DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT RATHER THAN BEING LIKE I HAVE  WILL YOU CLOSE ITWALKER OH NO NEVER SHOW YOUR HANDSEGARRA OKWALKER I WOULD JUST SAY HEY WHATS THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT AND THEN SEE WHAT THEYLL OFFER BUT THEYRE NOT

ON YOUR OWN TO KEEP CALLING BACK AND KEEP HAVING IT ON YOUR CALENDAR LIKE ITS THIS REMINDER OF THIS DEBT HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD BUT MAYBE ALSO A REMINDER OF SOMETHING PAINFUL THAT YOU WENT THROUGHWALKER OH YEAH I MEAN IT IS ITS SO HARD THERES SO MUCH TRAUMA AROUND LIKE  YEAH YOU ONLY HAVE THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU HAD SOME MEDICAL EMERGENCY THAT HAPPENED SO LIKE IF THAT IS YOU KNOW  THAT CAN BE SUPER PAINFUL AND A LOT OF TIMES YEAH YOU DO NEED AN ADVOCATE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE RECOVERING FROM SOME SURGERY OR YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH CHEMO OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE LIKE YOU DONT HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO BE CALLING THE HOSPITAL ALL THE TIMESEGARRA IT SEEMS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO SUPPORT YOU IN A CONCRETE WAY SO MAYBE IF A FRIEND IS LIKE HEY HOW CAN I HELP

SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT TEXTED OR CALLED THAT ANXIOUS FEELING OF EVERY TIME YOUR PHONE BUZZES YOU THINK MAYBE ITS THEM OR ON THE FLIP SIDE I HOPE IT ISNT THEM  IM NOT READY TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE EMOTIONS TYPICALLY THAT TYPE OF DRAMA AND ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS IS RESERVED FOR DATING AND ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT FOR ME IT HAPPENED WITH A FRIEND SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN A REALLY CLOSE LONGTERM FRIEND WE STARTED TO DRIFT APART AND I COULD TELL BUT I DIDNT WANT TO ACCEPT IT SO I SHRUGGED IT OFF FIRST THE PHONE CALLS BECAME LESS AND LESS OUR USUAL HANGOUTS WENT FROM MONTHLY TO JUST ONCE IN A BLUE MOON NEITHER OF US SAID ANYTHING TO THE OTHER WE BOTH JUST SLIPPED OUT OF EACH OTHERS LIVES I HATE TO ADMIT IT BUT I HAVENT BEEN THE SAME SINCE I FEEL LIKE I HAVENT REALLY PROCESSED THE LOSSMARISA FRANCO WHEN WE LOSE FRIENDS WE HAVE TROUBLE PROCESSING THE LOSS BECAUSE SOCIETY DOESNT VALUE THE LOSS PART OF THE WAYS WE GRIEVE IS PEOPLE AROUND US SAYING IM SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS THIS IS DEVASTATING BUT WHEN YOU LOSE A FRIEND ITS LIKE WHY ARE YOU STILL HUNG UP ON THIS YOU KNOWOPONG THATS FRIENDSHIP EXPERT MARISA FRANCO SHES THE AUTHOR OF PLATONIC HOW THE SCIENCE OF ATTACHMENT CAN HELP YOU MAKE  AND KEEP  FRIENDS ADULT FRIENDSHIPS TAKE TIME EFFORT AND ATTENTION AND WHEN YOU PUT IN THE WORK TO BUILD A STRONG BOND WITH SOMEONE ONLY TO LOSE THEM THE LOSS CAN BE REALLY HARDFRANCO FRIENDSHIP GRIEF CAN BE SO COMPLICATED CAUSE WE DONT GET PERMISSION FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN WE DONT GET PERMISSION FROM OURSELVES SO ITS A WAY THAT WE TRIVIALIZE FRIENDSHIP WHICH THEN LEADS US TO TRIVIALIZE THE GRIEF OF FRIENDSHIP LOSSOPONG MORE THAN FOUR YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LOSS OF THE LONGTERM FRIENDSHIP I HAD SOMETIMES I WONDER IF ILL EVER BE ABLE TO REALLY MOVE ON MARISA SAYS THATS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE A CLOSE FRIEND IT CAN FEEL LIKE YOURE LOSING A PART OF YOURSELFFRANCO WHEN WE GET CLOSE TO SOMEONE WE INCLUDE THEM IN OUR SENSE OF OURSELVES SO THE LOSS OF THEM LITERALLY FEELS LIKE A LOSS OF PART OF OUR IDENTITY THE LOSS OF THIS EXPERIENCE WE MIGHT HAVE FOR WHO WAS DRAWN OUT IN THAT PERSONS COMPANYOPONG IM DIANA OPONG AND ON TODAYS EPISODE OF LIFE KIT  COPING WITH A FRIEND BREAKUP WERE GIVING THIS TOPIC THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES THE ATTENTION OUR SOCIETY DOESNT CAUSE WE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS HOPE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF FRIENDSHIP LOSSSOUNDBITE OF HENRY ARCHER AND JUSTIN CASEYS NIGHT CRUISINGOPONG SO FRIENDS AS WE KNOW CAN BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES AND I HAVE A SLEW OF FRIENDS A LOT OF THEM ODDLY ARE NAMED LISA PH OR MEGAN PH ITS REALLY FUNNYFRANCO LAUGHTEROPONG IT GIVES MY KIDS AND MY FAMILY A BIT OF A LAUGH LIKE WHICH ONE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AND SO  AND SOME OF THEM IVE KNOWN SINCE I WAS IN ELEMENTARY OR MIDDLE SCHOOL WEVE YOU KNOW HAD THESE FRIENDSHIPS THAT HAVE JUST LASTED A LONG TIME AND I MEAN LIKE IN MY WEDDING AUNTIES TO MY KIDSTYPE FRIENDS RIGHT BUT NOT EVERY FRIENDSHIP IS LIKE THAT WHAT ARE SOME COMMON REASONS FRIENDSHIPS ENDFRANCO YOU KNOW WHATS INTERESTING THAT  THERES ONE STUDY THAT FOUND THAT THE MOST COMMON REASON IS JUST BECAUSE THINGS FIZZLE OUT LIKE NOBODY REALLY NECESSARILY WANTED THE FRIENDSHIP TO END BUT PEOPLE KIND OF GOT BUSY AND DIDNT INTENTIONALLY MAINTAIN THE FRIENDSHIP AND THERES ANOTHER STUDY THAT FINDS THAT ABOUT EVERY SEVEN YEARS WE LOSE ABOUT HALF OF OUR FRIENDS SO ITS EXTREMELY COMMON TO LOSE FRIENDS TO AT SOME PERIOD BE VERY HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND THEN IN ANOTHER PERIOD FEEL LIKE OH I WISH I HAD MORE FRIENDSBUT I WOULD SAY WHEN FRIENDSHIPS END MORE INTENTIONALLY THERE CAN BE THINGS LIKE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH RECIPROCITY AND SO SOMEONE GETS UPSET OVER TIME YOU KNOW WITH FRIENDSHIP WERE NOT VERY GOOD AT CONFLICT IN FRIENDSHIP WE DONT MAKE THE UNSAID SAID SO SMALL THINGS CAN KIND OF ACCUMULATE OVER TIME AND BECAUSE THEYRE NEVER DIRECTLY ADDRESSED PEOPLE GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY WANT TO END THE FRIENDSHIP BEFORE ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM WHEREAS IF THEY HAD INTERVENED SOONER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE THE FRIENDSHIP SO THATS ALSO A PATTERN THAT I SEE THATS REALLY UNFORTUNATEOPONG YEAH SO LETS TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU MENTION SOMETIMES THINGS FIZZLE OUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT YOU SEE WHEN A FRIENDSHIPS ON ITS WAY TO POSSIBLY ENDINGFRANCO YEAH YEAH WELL I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE A HEALTHY FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED MUTUALITY BOTH PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT BOTH PEOPLES NEEDS SO IM NOT EXPECTING MY FRIEND TO ALWAYS MEET MY NEEDS AT THEIR GREAT EXPENSE SO IM NOT EXPECTING THEM TO ALWAYS DRIVE AN HOUR TO SEE ME AND NEVER BE WILLING TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE IM NOT EXPECTING THEM TO ALWAYS HAVE TO REACH OUT TO ME AND IM NEVER GOING TO INITIATE MYSELFBUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT DONT RESPECT MUTUALITY IN FRIENDSHIPS AND THEY EXPECT THEIR FRIENDS TO CONSISTENTLY GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WITHOUT MEETING THEIR FRIENDS HALFWAY AND SO FRIENDSHIPS THAT ARE DEVOID OF THAT MUTUALITY TEND TO BE LESS HEALTHY AND ALSO I THINK LESS SUSTAINABLE OVER TIME BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARENT GETTING THEIR NEEDS MET THEN THEYRE NOT GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE A RELATIONSHIPSO THERES THIS FACTOR CALLED RESPONSIVENESS AND ITS BASICALLY LIKE THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOURE WILLING TO MEET SOMEONES NEEDS LIKE MY FRIENDS LATE AND IM LIKE HEY IM SAD CAN YOU TRY TO COME ON TIME AND THEYRE LIKE YEAH ABSOLUTELY ITS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF DEFENSIVENESS IF THEYRE RESPONSIVE THEY SAY YEAH AND THEY ACTUALLY TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT IF THEYRE DEFENSIVE THEY SAY YOURE TOO SENSITIVE WHY ARE YOU MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS AND THEY DONT TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ALSO LOW IN RESPONSIVENESS MAKE THEIR FRIENDS FEEL MORE INSECURE AND HAVE LESS SUSTAINABLE FRIENDSHIPSOPONG OK SO WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE MAYBE NOTICE THAT RIGHT SO WE HAVE A FRIEND THAT WERE REALIZING THERES NOT MUTUALITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP HOW DO WE HANDLE A SITUATION LIKE THATFRANCO HMM WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THE BEAUTY ABOUT FRIENDSHIP IS THAT THERE IS SUCH A SPECTRUM OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MEANS THAT WE DONT HAVE TO HANDLE FRIENDSHIPS IN ABSOLUTES LIKE WE TEND TO WITH A ROMANTIC PARTNER RIGHT YOU DONT FULFILL MY NEEDS ITS OVER YOU CAN DECIDE OK YOU DONT FULFILL MY NEEDS BUT YOU FULFILL THIS OTHER NEED IN MY LIFE SO MAYBE IM GOING TO MOVE YOU DOWN ON THE SPECTRUM OF INTIMACY MAYBE INSTEAD OF BEING A CLOSE FRIEND YOULL BE A FRIEND MAYBE INSTEAD OF BEING A FRIEND YOULL BE MORE LIKE A FRIENDLY ACQUAINTANCE OR A GROUP FRIEND THAT I ALMOST ONLY SEE IN GROUP SITUATIONS AND I REALIZE THAT MY NEEDS FOR SOMEONE WHOS IN MY INNERMOST MOST INTIMATE CIRCLE YOURE NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO FULFILL THEM AND THUS I WILL CHANGE HOW I ORIENT TO THE FRIENDSHIPOPONG YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTION IS THAT SOMETIMES FRIENDSHIPS END BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF CONFLICT AND DONT EVER TALK ABOUT IT I GUESS HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITH AN INTENTIONAL FRIENDSHIPFRANCO YEAHOPONG WHEN YOU DONT WANT IT TO JUST ENDFRANCO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE UNSAID SAID FOR ME WHEN I FIND MYSELF STARTING TO WITHDRAW OR WANTING TO CONTACT THIS FRIEND LESS  IN THE PAST I WOULD WITHDRAW AND THUS THE FRIENDSHIP WOULD NO LONGER BE SUSTAINABLE BUT NOW I KNOW THAT IF I WANT TO WITHDRAW THATS A SIGN THATS A SIGN THAT I NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT TOOK ME REFRAMING CONFLICT AS I READ A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS THAT  FOR EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE THAT REALLY VALUE FRIENDSHIPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ADDRESS ISSUES RATHER THAN JUST PULL AWAY AND THAT HAVING OPEN CONFLICT IS ACTUALLY LINKED TO HAVING DEEPER INTIMACY WHEN THE CONFLICT IS DONE IN A VERY EMPATHIC WAYSO I REMEMBER WITH ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IT WAS A SERIES OF SMALL THINGS THAT GAVE ME THIS DESIRE TO WITHDRAW AND I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THIS PLACE WHERE ITS LIKE OH EITHER I WITHDRAW OR WE HAVE A COMBATIVE ANTAGONISTIC CONVERSATION THERE IS NO GOOD OPTION HERE BUT AS IM READING ALL THIS RESEARCH IM LIKE THERE IS A GOOD OPTION LIKE YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION THATS LOVING AND CONCILIATORY AND SO THATS WHAT I BROUGHT TO THE FRIENDSHIP MY FRIEND ACTUALLY CRIED BECAUSE SHE WAS LIKE IVE NEVER HAD A CONFLICT CONVERSATION THATS FELT THIS HEALING AND THIS KIND BEFOREOPONG WOWFRANCO AND I WAS JUST LIKE YEAH LIKE ITS ACTUALLY LOVELY I FEEL SO CLOSE TO YOU SO NOW I KNOW THAT IF I FEEL THE NEED TO WITHDRAW I NEED TO BRING UP THE ISSUE INSTEAD AND THAT THATS AN ACT OF SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE IT INDICATES IM INVESTED ENOUGH TO WORK THROUGH THIS WITH YOU AND I REALIZE HOW UNFAIR IT WAS WHEN I WOULD JUST WITHDRAW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SOMETIMES LIKE IM SAYING YOURE GUILTY WITHOUT GIVING YOU A TRIALOPONG YEAH SO WHEN THERE IS A SHIFT IN OUR FRIENDSHIPS IT CAN BE HARD TO ADMIT THAT THINGS ARENT LIKE THEY USED TO BE AND IT CAN BE HARD TO DEAL WITH SO WHAT CAN SOMEONE DO IF THEY FEEL A FRIEND PULLING AWAY OR THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WANT TO PULL AWAY WHATS THE FIRST STEPFRANCO I WOULD CHECK IN WITH THE FRIEND AND ASK WHATS GOING ON LIKE HEY YOU KNOW I NOTICED WE HAVENT BEEN IN CONTACT AS MUCH YOU KNOW I WASNT SURE IF YOURE JUST BUSY OR IF THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING GOING ON ON YOUR END THAT YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT LIKE EITHER WAY ID LOVE TO HEAR IM ALL EARS YOU KNOW SO JUST DOING THAT REALLY BENIGN CHECKIN  BECAUSE ITS TRUE SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET REALLY BUSY AND YOU HEAR FROM THEM LESS VERSUS THEM YOU KNOW WANTING TO PULL AWAY FROM THE FRIENDSHIP SO JUST OFFERING THAT CLARIFYING COMMENT CAN BE VERY HELPFULIF YOURE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO WITHDRAW FROM A FRIENDSHIP AND THE FRIEND STILL WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION YOU TRIGGER IF YOU DONT ADDRESS THINGS DIRECTLY SOMETHING CALLED AMBIGUOUS LOSS WHICH MEANS WE CANT PROCESS OUR GRIEF BECAUSE WE DONT UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENEDOPONG YESFRANCO WE ARE MEANINGMAKING CREATURES AS HUMAN BEINGS WE NEED THAT MEANING TO BE ABLE TO REALLY HELP US THROUGH OUR GRIEF SO THATS WHY I THINK THE KINDEST THING TO DO IF YOURE WITHDRAWING FROM A FRIEND WHO STILL WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND THAT YOU HAVE AN ESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIP WITH IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ITOPONG OOH HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT THATS  ITS SO HARD MARISAFRANCO ITS SO HARDOPONG SO AS YOU MENTIONED SOME FRIENDSHIPS DRIFT APART AND SOME CAN BE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED  LIKE GHOSTING SO WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES WE CAN USE WHEN SOMEONE GHOSTS US WERE NOT THE GHOSTER PH BUT WERE THE GHOSTEE PHFRANCO OH ITS SUCH A HARD PLACE TO BE I MEAN I THINK ITS JUST LIKE  THE LESS WE CAN INTERNALIZE IT THE BETTER LIKE THE LESS WE CAN SAY OH I GOT GHOSTED CAUSE IM AWFUL AND NO ONE LIKES ME  AND THE LESS WE GENERALIZE IT SO IN CONTRAST WE WANT TO SEE IT AS YOU KNOW I STILL FEEL LIKE I HAVE GREAT QUALITIES ABOUT ME I TRUST THAT NOT ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO TREAT ME THIS WAY I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I STILL DO HAVE GOOD FRIENDS IN MY LIFE DESPITE THIS FRIEND NOT WANTING TO BE A PART OF MY LIFE ANYMORE I KNOW ITS EASIER SAID THAN DONE BUT I THINK THATS WHERE WE WANT TO END UP SO THAT WE WONT BE GRIEVING IN A MORE PROLONGED WAYOPONG OK SO WHAT I FEEL LIKE IM HEARING YOU SAY IS NO MATTER HOW YOUR FRIENDSHIP ENDS WHETHER SORT OF DRAMATICALLY LIKE IF YOUVE BEEN GHOSTED OR IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP SORT OF JUST FIZZLES OUT I FEEL LIKE OFTEN THE MAIN EMOTION WERE EXPERIENCING IN THAT SITUATION IS GRIEF RIGHTFRANCO EXACTLY AND I WILL SAY YOURE ALSO GRIEVING PART OF YOURSELFOPONG OKFRANCO BECAUSE IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP WE ARE EXPERIENCING A DIFFERENT PART OF OURSELVES LIKE YOU KNOW RESEARCH TERM  INCLUSION OF OTHERS IN THE SELF WHEN WE GET CLOSE TO SOMEONE WE INCLUDE THEM IN OUR SENSE OF OURSELVES SO THE LOSS OF THEM LITERALLY FEELS LIKE A LOSS OF OURSELVES AND A LOSS OF PART OF OUR IDENTITY THE LOSS OF THIS EXPERIENCE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR WHO WAS DRAWN OUT IN THAT PERSONS COMPANY AND SO THE GRIEF HERE IS LAYERED ITS NOT SMALL ITS NOT INSIGNIFICANT YOURE GRIEVING A RELATIONSHIP YOURE ALSO GRIEVING AN ASPECT OF YOUR IDENTITY WHERE YOURE JUST LIKE HOW CAN I FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO FEEL THIS WAY I FEEL LIKE ALMOST LIKE LESS OF ME IF IT WAS YOU KNOW A PARTICULARLY STRONG FRIENDSHIP AND SO I THINK YOURE RIGHT THE AMBIGUITY MAKES IT SO COMPLICATED THE CONNECTION MAKES IT SO COMPLICATED THE WAY WE TRIVIALIZE FRIENDSHIP MAKES IT SO COMPLICATED ITS ALSO REALLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP IS SO AMBIGUOUS OUR FRIEND COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR FRIENDSHIP THAN WE DOOPONG YEAHFRANCO WHICH IS MAYBE PART OF WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONFLICT WHERE WERE LIKE MY FRIENDS TO ME ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS MY SPOUSE BUT THEYRE LIKE NO FRIENDS TO ME ARE SOMETHING TRIVIAL AND SOMETHING LESSER RIGHTOPONG YEAHFRANCO AND SO I DONT HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND IF I END THE FRIENDSHIP AND THAT FEELS OK FOR MEOPONG YEAHFRANCO AND SO BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP IS SO AMBIGUOUS THEY MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING THAN WE DO WHICH CAN LEAVE US WITH THAT AMBIGUOUS LOSS  CAN LEAVE US WITH THAT SENSE THAT I DONT HAVE MEANINGMAKING I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ENDED THEY WERENT WILLING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH ME OR THERE WERE THESE IMPLICIT DIFFERENCES IN OUR EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF HOW WE VIEW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A FRIEND THAT WE NEVER PUT ON THE TABLE BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FRIENDSHIP ENDINGOPONG YEAH YEAH AND SO IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO ADMIT THAT A FRIENDSHIP IS OVER  LIKE ESPECIALLY A CLOSE INTENTIONAL FRIENDSHIP HOW CAN WE TELL THAT A FRIENDSHIP IS OVER THOUGH IS IT JUST SOMETHING WE FEEL OR IS IT LIKE YEAH NO THIS ISNT WORKINGFRANCO I LIKE TO SAY THAT IF THE EVIDENCE IS AMBIGUOUS REMAIN HOPEFUL RIGHT SO IF YOURE LIKE I TEXTED MY FRIEND THREE WEEKS AGO SHE DIDNT RESPOND AND I DONT KNOW IF THERES  THERES NO EVIDENCE THAT THERES ANY OTHER ISSUES BETWEEN US  RIGHT  SHE HASNT BROUGHT UP ANY ISSUES BETWEEN US I LIKE TO SAY START WITH THE HOPE THAT YOURE STILL FRIENDS BECAUSE WHEN WE START ASSUMING THAT SOMETHING AMBIGUOUS IS REJECTION WE BEGIN TO REJECT BACK AND IT BECOMES A SELFFULFILLING PROPHECY LIKE SHE DIDNT TEXT ME BACK THREE WEEKS AGO NOW IM NOT GOING TO TEXT HER EVER AGAINOPONG YEAHFRANCO BUT IF YOURE HOPEFUL AND YOURE LIKE OH OK THIS IS AN AMBIGUOUS SITUATION I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON IM GOING TO ASSUME THAT THIS PERSON STILL LOVES ME THEN YOURE GOING TO REACH OUT AND SAY OH HEY DID YOU SEE MY TEXT FROM THREE WEEKS AGO AND THEN ITS GOING TO  FRIENDSHIP IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON THERES THIS STUDY ON LONGDISTANCE FRIENDS THAT FOUND THAT IF YOU SEE THEM FLEXIBLE BUT NOT FRAGILE THEYRE MORE LIKELY TO LAST SO THATS LIKE OH WELL GO IN AND OUT OF PERIODS OF CLOSENESS WELL GO IN AND OUT OF TALKING THATS A NORMAL PART OF THE FRIENDSHIP WE DONT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE HIGH LEVEL OF INTIMACYOPONG YEPFRANCO SO STARTING THAT CHECKIN WHICH OPENS UP THE CONVERSATION  CAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THIS CONVERSATION OF CONFLICT BECAUSE THEY THINK MY FRIENDS GOING TO REJECT ME AND THEYRE GOING TO GET DEFENSIVE AND ITS GOING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE SO IF YOU PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE TO SIGNAL THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE WHEN YOU BRING THINGS UP  IT CAN GIVE YOUR FRIEND THE REASSURANCE THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO ACTUALLY BRING UP THE PROBLEMOPONG OK SO SAY WE KNOW ITS OVER RIGHT ITS DONE THE FRIENDSHIP IS NOT HEALTHY ANYMORE BUT WE STILL REALLY WANT TO REACH OUT AND SEE IF WE CAN RECONNECT OR REPAIR THINGS SHOULD WE AVOID CRAWLING BACKFRANCO WHOO  I MEAN I THINK YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF WHATS DIFFERENT NOW YOU KNOW LIKE AND IF THE ANSWER IS NOTHING LAUGHTER THEN MAYBE LEAVE IT BE BUT IF THE ANSWER IS HEY YOU KNOW I WENT TO SOME THERAPY THIS IS SOME THINGS IVE CHANGED ABOUT MYSELF THAT I REALIZE CAME OUT IN THIS FRIENDSHIP I UNDERSTAND THE WAYS THAT I WASNT GREAT OR UNFAIR WITH THIS FRIEND OR MAYBE IT WAS OH I WAS AT A LIFE STAGE WHERE I COULDNT REALLY BE A GOOD FRIEND YOU KNOW I WAS GOING THROUGH X Y Z I JUST HAD MY SMALL KIDS NOW IM NOT IN THAT LIFE STAGE THEN IT MIGHT BE A SIGN THAT YOU CAN RECONNECT BUT IF YOU CANT ANSWER THE QUESTION  WHATS DIFFERENT NOW  WITH ANYTHING THEN IT MIGHT BE A SIGN THAT ITS AT LEAST NOT NOW A TIME TO RECONNECT WITH THAT PERSONOPONG HMM WHAT ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO MOVING FORWARD INTO NEW FRIENDSHIPS AFTER A REALLY INTENTIONAL FRIENDSHIP HAS ENDEDFRANCO YEAHOPONG SO THAT WE DONT EITHER CARRY IN THOSE SAME MISTAKES OR SOME OF THOSE NEGATIVE WELLTHISMUSTBEHOWITSGOINGTOBEFOREVER KIND OF THOUGHTSFRANCO LAUGHTER YEAH SO JUST REMINDING YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED LIKE THIS DOESNT MEAN MORE FRIENDSHIPS WILL HAPPEN LIKE THIS  LIKE TRYING TO GIVE YOURSELF A FRESH PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU ENTER INTO THOSE NEW FRIENDSHIPS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT YOURE NOT GOING IN FEARFUL AND GOING IN FROM A PROTECTIVE STATE WHERE THEN YOULL KIND OF REJECT OR BE VERY WARY OF THE LOVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE FOR YOU I THINK YOU KNOW SPENDING TIME PROCESSING YOUR GRIEF IS REALLY REALLY GREAT LIKE SPENDING TIME WITH THOSE EMOTIONS  NOT JUST TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THEM OR DISENGAGE FROM THEM  WILL MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THOSE EMOTIONS CONTINUE TO COLOR YOUR FRIENDSHIPS IN THE FUTURE ACKNOWLEDGING THE BOUNTY AND THE BEAUTY OF THE FRIENDSHIPS THAT YOU DO HAVE  WERE WAY BETTER AT CONNECTING WHEN OUR NEEDS FOR CONNECTION ARE MET ELSEWHERE  AND SO MAKING SURE YOURE LEANING ON THE FRIENDS THAT YOU DO HAVE AND FEELING THE CLOSENESS AND INTIMACY OF THOSE FRIENDS IS ALSO GOING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT YOUR IMAGE OF FRIENDSHIP IN YOUR BRAIN ISNT JUST COLORED BY THIS ONE EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH THIS BREAKUP BUT YOUR IMAGE OF FRIENDSHIP ALSO INCLUDES  THIS IS ALL THE LOVE THATS IN MY LIFE TOO FROM THESE OTHER FRIENDS THAT IVE KEPTOPONG YEAH GOSH I LOVE THAT SO MUCH THANK YOU MARISAFRANCO THANK YOU FOR USING YOUR EXPERIENCE TO HELP SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE TOOOPONG THANK YOUSOUNDBITE OF MUSICOPONG FOR MORE LIFE

EVERYBODY MARIELLE SEGARRA HERE WHEN I WAS MAYBE  MY HIGH SCHOOL BROUGHT IN AN ABSTINENCEONLY SEX EDUCATOR I REMEMBER THIS SCHOOL ASSEMBLY LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY SHE STOOD UP THERE ON A STAGE AND SAID THINGS LIKE HAVING SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE IS LIKE PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE AND THAT IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE SEX PARTNER IN YOUR LIFE YOU WILL PAY BECAUSE YOU WILL GET AN STI AND IN THE PICTURE SHE PAINTED YOUR LIFE WILL BE OVER IM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO GOT MESSAGES LIKE THIS ABOUT SEX AT A YOUNG AGE AND THOSE MESSAGES STICK WITH USEVELIN DACKER I LIKE TO SAY THE WORST STIS THAT WE GIVE EACH OTHER ARE SHAME GUILT AND FEAR AND WE WALK AROUND WITH THAT A LOT WE WALK AROUND WITH THAT BAGGAGE OF OH MY GOSH IF I HAVE SEX WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE THEN THERE IS THIS THING THATS GOING TO GIVE ME THIS SHAME AND IF I EVER COME BACK WITH SOMETHING POSITIVE THEN THATS GOING TO MARK ME AS BEING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT DESIRABLESEGARRA THATS EVELIN DACKER A FAMILY PHYSICIAN IN OREGON WHO TEACHES PEOPLE HOW TO TALK ABOUT STIS AND SEXUALITY AND LOOK THERE ARE RISKS TO HAVING SEX STIS EXIST AND WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM IN THIS EPISODE BUT ALSO NOTHING IN LIFE IS RISKFREE WHEN YOU GET INTO A CAR OR YOU CROSS THE STREET OR YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT YOURE TAKING RISKSDACKER ITS THE SAME WITH SEXUALITY OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE LIKE OH MY GOSH IM SO SCARED OF AN STI AND IM LIKE WELL SOME OF THE HARDEST THINGS THAT PEOPLE GIVE YOU ARE NOT STIS IT COULD BE BROKEN HEARTS THEY MAY MISTREAT YOU YOU KNOW THERES A LOT THAT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS ON WHEN WE START BECOMING INTIMATE WITH PEOPLE STIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE TAKE A RISK ON AND WITH GOOD COMMUNICATION TESTING USE OF BARRIERS VACCINES WE REALLY HAVE ALL THOSE TOOLS TO REALLY HELP MINIMIZE US HAVING SOMETHING THAT WILL AFFECT US FOR THE REST OF OUR LIFESEGARRA SO ON TODAYS EPISODE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT STIS WELL LAY OUT THE SCIENCE FOR YOU AND THEN GIVE YOU SOME LANGUAGE TO TALK ABOUT THEM AND MORE BROADLY ABOUT SEX WITH A POTENTIAL PARTNER BECAUSE FOR SOMETHING THATS SO FUN SEX CAN BE REALLY HARD TO TALK ABOUTSOUNDBITE OF MUSICSEGARRA SO LETS DO A  JUST A PRIMER ON STIS THERE ARE TWO MAIN CATEGORIES RIGHT THERES BACTERIAL AND VIRAL CAN YOU TALK FIRST ABOUT BACTERIALDACKER YEAH SO BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ARE THOSE  THE MAIN ONES THAT WE TALK ABOUT ARE GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA AND SYPHILIS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE AND VIRAL ARE THAT THEYRE TREATABLE WITH AN ANTIBIOTICSEGARRA OK SO ONCE YOU TREAT THEM THEY GO AWAY ENTIRELYDACKER THEY GO AWAY UNLESS YOU GET REINFECTED WITH THEM YESSEGARRA OK AND THEN WHAT ABOUT VIRALDACKER SO THE VIRAL INFECTIONS ARE HIV HPV AND HERPES THERES ALSO HEPATITIS ONES OUR BODY DOES TEND TO SUPPRESS THESE WITH OUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM SOME VIRAL INFECTIONS THOUGH ARENT SUPPRESSED JUST BY OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO TAKE MEDICATIONS TO ACTUALLY DECREASE THE VIRUS SO IT DOESNT BECOME TRANSMISSIBLESEGARRA GOT IT CAN WE TALK A BIT ABOUT HERPES I FEEL LIKE ITS CONFUSING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SO IF YOU ARE DIAGNOSED WITH HERPES WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN WHAT EFFECT CAN THAT HAVE ON YOUR BODY WHAT ARE THE RISKSDACKER THERES TWO TYPES OF HERPES THERES THE COLD SORE TYPE THAT MOST OF THE TIME COMES UP IN YOUR MOUTH BUT ACTUALLY CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO GENITALS AND THEN THERES HERPES IN THE GENITAL REGION SO WHEN YOU GET A HERPES OUTBREAK IF ITS ON THE MOUTH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THAT YOU KNOW YOU GET LIKE AN ULCER AND ITS PAINFUL AND THEN IT DRIES UP AND GOES AWAY GENITAL HERPES IS SIMILAR BUT IT COULD BE MULTIPLE LESIONS AND ULCERS THAT OCCUR IN THE GENITAL YOU KNOW PELVIC REGION SOME PEOPLE DONT HAVE IT ON THEIR GENITALS THEY COULD HAVE IT ON THEIR HIPS OR THEIR BUTTOCKS AS WELLSO THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY GETS IT THEY MAY HAVE LIKE A FLULIKE SYMPTOMS WHERE THEY GET A COLD AND JUST DONT FEEL WELL VERSUS LATER ON WHEN THEY GET IT ITS JUST THIS RASH AND IT COULD BE PAINFUL FEEL LIKE BURNING NEEDLES AND THAT IS WHAT WERE ALL SCARED OF BUT IS IT SOMETHING LIFETHREATENING NO THE LONGER PEOPLE HAVE HERPES AND IF THEY KNOW THEIR SYMPTOMS AND THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSES AN OUTBREAK THEY COULD ACTUALLY MANAGE IT VERY WELL SO IF SOMEBODY IS DISCLOSING THAT THEY HAVE IT THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THEY KNOW THEIR BODY THEY KNOW THEIR SYMPTOMS AND THEY COULD HELP PREVENT PASSING IT ONSEGARRA OK AND THEN WITH HERPES THERE IS AN ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO KEEP THE VIRAL LOAD LOW IN YOUR BODY SO THAT ITS LESS LIKELY YOULL HAVE AN OUTBREAK OR PASS IT ON TO SOMEONE ELSEDACKER YES SO ITS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT BUT IT CAN DEFINITELY REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE HELP REDUCE PASSING IT ON TO OTHER PEOPLESEGARRA OK AND THEN LAST QUESTION ON HERPES IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE AND YOU HAVE IT OR THEY HAVE IT IS IT RECOMMENDED TO USE PROTECTION ALWAYS OR  AND WHAT ABOUT WITH ORAL SEXDACKER YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL I DONT LIKE USING THE WORD PROTECTION I FEEL LIKE THATS ONE OF THOSE WORDS THAT WE THINK LIKE OH IF WE USE BARRIERS OR CONDOMS THEN WERE PROTECTED WHEN THE TRUTH IS IS THAT BECAUSE IT EXISTS IN KIND OF LIKE THE BOXER SHORT REGION EVEN IF YOURE COVERING JUST YOUR GENITALS YOU STILL MAY BE PASSING IT ON IF ITS SKINTOSKIN CONTACTSEGARRA GOT ITDACKER SO THERES REALLY NO WAY OF A HUNDRED PERCENT PROTECTING ONESELF BUT THERES WAYS OF MINIMIZING AND THE WAYS OF MINIMIZING HERPES PARTICULARLY IS ONE DISCLOSING BECAUSE JUST BY TALKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW YOU COULD SAY OH I KNOW WHEN I HAVE IT IM GOING TO GET AN OUTBREAK I FEEL IT THOSE ARE THE TIMES THAT WE SHOULDNT YOU KNOW HAVE ANY SKINTOSKIN CONTACT BARRIERS ARE APPROPRIATE TO USE  CONDOMS  INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CONDOMS ARE A  SOMETHING TO HELP MINIMIZE BUT ITS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT AND WITH ORAL SEX AGAIN ITS REALLY ABOUT KNOWING YOUR BODY IF YOU DO HAVE ORAL HERPES IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DISCLOSE THAT AS WELL AND FEELING ANY TINGLING OR STRESS OR AN OUTBREAK THEN YOU JUST AVOID ANY ORAL TRANSMISSION OF ITSEGARRA OK LETS TALK ABOUT HPV ANOTHER ONE THAT I THINK IS CONFUSING FOR FOLKS SO WHATS THE EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS ITDACKER HPV IS KIND OF LIKE THE COMMON COLD OF STIS PRETTY MUCH IF YOU HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON OR YOUR PARTNER HAS HAD CONTACT WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN VACCINATED THEN THE CHANCES ARE PRETTY HIGH YOURE GOING TO GET ONE OF THE STRAINS THAT ARE OUT THERE REALLY WE BREAK THEM OUT INTO HIGHRISK AND LOWRISK LOWRISK ARE THE ONES THAT CAN CAUSE EXTERNAL GENITAL WARTS AND THEY JUST USUALLY CLEAR AND GO AWAY OR THEY CAN CAUSE ISSUES IN THE CERVIX VAGINA OR THROAT BUT TEND TO NOT CAUSE CANCER THE HIGHRISK ONES ARE THE ONES THAT WERE THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY COULD LEAD TO CANCER THEY COULD LEAD TO CERVICAL CANCER THROAT CANCERS AS WELL AS EXTERNAL VULVAR CANCER AND ANAL CANCER AS WELL BUT NOT ALL OF THEM DO SO WERE SCARED OF HPV BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES IT CAN GIVE US WHICH MEANS CANCER SO WE TRY TO MINIMIZE HAVING  GETTING THOSE INFECTIONS AND THE ONE BEST WAY OF MINIMIZING IT IS BY GETTING IMMUNIZEDSEGARRA AND SO THE VACCINE  YOU CAN GET IT AT THIS POINT ANY AGE ANY GENDERDACKER ITS FDAAPPROVED UP TO THE AGE OF SEGARRA OH OKDACKER FOR ANY GENDER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO GET IT BEYOND THE AGE OF  THE REASON ITS NOT RECOMMENDED IS CAUSE IT REALLY HASNT BEEN STUDIED AND WE THINK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER THE AGE OF  HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN THAT VIRUSSEGARRA OK AND THEN IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUVE HAD A FORM OF HPV DOES IT MAKE SENSE STILL TO GET THE VACCINEDACKER YES BECAUSE THE VACCINE IS AGAINST NINE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF IT SO IF YOU MAY HAVE HAD ONE OF THE STRAINS ITLL HELP PROTECT YOU AGAINST ALL THE OTHER STRAINS AND IT HELPS MINIMIZE CERVICAL CANCER BECAUSE IT MIGHT HELP PROTECT YOU AGAINST ONE OF THE HIGHER RISK ONESSEGARRA OK AND THEN LETS ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIV YOU MENTIONED THAT NOW THERE ARE ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS THATLL SUPPRESS THE VIRAL LOAD TO THE POINT WHERE YOURE NOT GOING TO PASS THE VIRUS ON TO YOUR PARTNERDACKER RIGHT RIGHTSEGARRA IS IT STILL RECOMMENDED TO USE A BARRIER WHEN YOU HAVE SEXDACKER UNTIL YOU HAVE HAD A REAL GOOD CONVERSATION DISCLOSURE AND YOU KNOW YOUR PARTNERS NEEDS AND BOUNDARIES AND RISKS ITS  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND USING BARRIERSSEGARRA OK SO IF ITS WITH SOMEONE NEW ANDDACKER YESSEGARRA BUT IF YOURE IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP ITS DIFFERENTDACKER IF YOURE IN A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS HIV AND HAS VIRAL TESTING AND THEY KNOW THAT THEYRE NO LONGER  THERES NO DETECTABLE VIRUS YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE BARRIERS IN THAT CASE BECAUSE ITS NOT TRANSMISSIBLE ANYMORESEGARRA OK THERES ALSO A MEDICATION CALLED PREP RIGHT ITS DIFFERENT THAN THE ANTIVIRALS YOUD TAKE IF YOU HAVE HIVDACKER ITS A COCKTAIL OF ANTIVIRALS THAT HELP YOU IF YOU WERE TO GET THE VIRUS INTRODUCED TO YOUR BODY HELPS KIND OF CLEAR ITSEGARRA SO ITS PREVENTATIVEDACKER YES ITS PREVENTATIVESEGARRA OKDACKER AND USED CORRECTLY ITS ALMOST  PREVENTATIVESEGARRA OK GOT IT I WONDER GIVEN THAT NOTHING IS RISKFREE HOW SOMEONE CAN COME UP WITH WHAT THEIR RULES ARE FOR THEMSELF OR WHAT THEIR GUIDELINES ARE FOR THEMSELF CAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH A NEW SEX PARTNER YOU KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOURE COMFORTABLE WITHDACKER ABSOLUTELYSEGARRA SO YOU CAN COMMUNICATE THATDACKER AND REALLY I THINK THAT AS WE NAVIGATE OUR OWN BODIES AND OUR OWN HEALTH WE START DISCOVERING THE THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR US YOU KNOW WHEN WERE YOUNG WERE WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISKS IN EVERYTHING LIKE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO GO AND DRINK TOO MUCH OR YOU KNOW THEYRE WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISKS THAT AS YOU START LEARNING YOUR LIFE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND YOUR BODY YOURE LIKE OH NO I CANT DO THAT THAT DOESNT FEEL GOOD TO DO THATSEGARRA YEAHDACKER AND SO THERES NO LIKE OH THIS IS WHAT YOURE GOING TO WANT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO PEOPLE ASK ME LIKE HOW OFTEN DO I GET TESTED OR WHEN SHOULD I GET TESTED AND IM LIKE WELL ITS LIKE  LIKE EVERY THREE MONTHS OR  MILES YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW YOU ARE HAVING SEX WITH PEOPLESEGARRA OK SO YOU HAVE THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE COMFORTABLE WITH IN TERMS OF RISK AND NOW YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE THINK OF THIS AS MORE THAN A CONVERSATION ABOUT STIS THINK OF IT AS A TALK ABOUT SEX EVELIN HAS A FRAMEWORK CALLED STARS YOU CAN USE IT AS A GUIDE IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS AND STARS IS AN ACRONYM WELL GO THROUGH IT THE S STANDS FOR SEXUAL HEALTH WHEN WERE YOU LAST TESTED FOR STIS AND HAVE YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR ONEDACKER YEAH I ALWAYS RECOMMEND STARTING WITH ONESELF TO ACTUALLY DISCLOSE ONES OWN STATUS ESPECIALLY LIKE WHEN YOU WERE LAST TESTED I DO RECOMMEND SAYING WHAT YOU WERE TESTED FOR AND IF YOUR RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE I TEND TO SAY  TO TRY TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO USE THE WORD CLEAN AND LASTLY THEN JUST END IT WITH HOW ABOUT YOU SO IT BECOMES AN INVITATION RATHER THAN WHEN WERE YOU LAST TESTEDSEGARRA ALSO IF ITS POSSIBLE YOU OR YOUR PARTNER COULD GET PREGNANT AND DONT WANT TO WHAT KIND OF CONTRACEPTION DO YOU USE THE T IS FOR TURNONS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU INTO SEXUALLY WHAT WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO TRYING AND WHEN A IS AVOIDS MAYBE YOU TELL THIS PERSON LISTEN I KNOW ITS KIND OF POPULAR NOW BUT PLEASE DO NOT CHOKE ME IF WERE HOOKING UP THE R IS FOR RELATIONSHIP INTENTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS YOU KNOW IM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MONOGAMOUS OR IM IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP OR IM LOOKING FOR A CASUAL CONSISTENT CONNECTION BUT NOT A RELATIONSHIP LIKE I DONT WANT THIS TO GET SUPER EMOTIONAL WHATEVER IT IS COMMUNICATE IT AND THE S IS SAFETY NEEDS IM NOT READY TO GO BACK TO YOUR PLACE YET OR HERES WHAT I NEED TO FEEL SAFE WHEN WERE HOOKING UPDACKER I TELL PEOPLE LIKE YOU WRITE IT OUT YOU WRITE YOUR STARS GUIDELINES AS YOU UNDERSTAND YOURSELF BETTER AND YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR NEEDS BETTER IT BECOMES MUCH EASIER TO COMMUNICATE THAT WITH SOMEBODY AND COMMUNICATE IT EARLY IN THE RELATIONSHIP VERSUS LATER ONSEGARRA SO LETS GAME THIS OUT MAYBE YOURE ON A DATE YOU HAVENT HAD SEX YET OR EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT BUT YOU DID TOUCH THEIR ARM EARLIER AND THAT FELT PRETTY ELECTRIC YOU WANT TO BRING THIS UP DO YOU DO IT AT THE RESTAURANT DO YOU DO IT IN THE CAB ON THE WAY BACK TO YOUR PLACE OR ONCE YOURE ALREADY KISSING ITS REALLY WHATEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BUT EVELINS SUGGESTIONDACKER I ALWAYS THINK THAT THE IDEAL TIME IS BEFORE YOUR CLOTHES COME OFFSEGARRA THAT SAID IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SO DONT FEEL LIKE JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDNT BRING IT UP BEFORE YOUR CLOTHES CAME OFF THAT IT CANT HAPPEN SO OK YOURE ON THAT DATE YOURE SITTING AT THE RESTAURANT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO GET THE CONVERSATION GOING YOU COULD TRY SOMETHING KIND OF BROAD LIKE HEY YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT THINGS MIGHT GET PHYSICAL WITH US TONIGHT I FEEL LIKE THATS THE VIBE I REALLY LIKE YOU THERES JUST STUFF I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THAT OR YOU COULD BRING STARS UP EXPLICITLY AND SAY SOMETHING LIKEDACKER HEY I HAVE THIS GAME TO PLAY DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME ITS CALLED A STARS TALKSEGARRA YOU COULD ALSO BE LIKE HEY I HEARD ABOUT THIS THING CALLED THE STARS TALK ITS ABOUT SEX AND WHAT WED BOTH BE INTO WOULD YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH IT BY TALKING ABOUT IT THIS WAY YOU MAKE THE CONVERSATION KIND OF SEXY AND ISNT THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT ON A DATESOUNDBITE OF MUSICSEGARRA OK TIME FOR A RECAP THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STIS  BACTERIAL AND VIRAL THE BACTERIAL STIS ARE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND THE VIRAL STIS CAN BE SUPPRESSED BY YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT IF THEYRE NOT YOU CAN TAKE ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS FOR SOME OF THEM THOSE MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOULL PASS THE VIRUS TO A PARTNER THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO PREVENT STIS  GET THE HPV VACCINE TAKE PREP USE BARRIERS LIKE CONDOMS WHEN HAVING SEX BUT AGAIN NOTHING IS RISKFREE  NOT SEX NOT DRIVING A CAR NOT GOING OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS NOTHING BUT WE DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE ITS IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHEN YOU BRING UP THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR SEX PARTNER DONT JUST FOCUS ON STIS TALK ABOUT WHAT YOURE INTO WHAT TURNS YOU ON AND WHAT DOESNT AND TRY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BEFORE YOUR CLOTHES COME OFF ITS EASIER THAT WAY BUT ITS ALSO NEVER TOO LATETHERES MORE OF MY CONVERSATION WITH EVELIN DACKER ON NPRS YOUTUBE PAGE WE GO INDEPTH ON HOW TO START TALKING ABOUT STIS AND HOW TO DISCLOSE IF YOU HAVE ONE

YO QUIERO DINERO IM HERE ON LIFE KIT TO TALK WITH PERSONAL FINANCE EXPERT AND AUTHOR MICHELLE SINGLETARY ABOUT HER NEW BOOK WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY WHEN CRISIS HITSFOR ME THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WHEN I WAS READING THE BOOK WAS LIKE THAT PAMPHLET THAT YOU SEE IN THE AIRPLANE BEFORE YOURE GOING TO TAKE OFF LIKE ITS NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO DRIVE THE PLANE BUT ITS GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IF SOMETHING GOES WRONGMICHELLE SINGLETARY OH I WISH I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE LAUGHTER I THINK THAT SO EXPLAINS THIS BOOK THERE ARE PLENTY OF GREAT PERSONAL FINANCE BOOKS OUT THERE BUT WHEN YOURE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS WHEN YOURE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO PAY YOURE NOT GOING TO GRAB A BOOK ON RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND READ IT  YOU KNOW  PAGES OF THAT YOU WANT A QUICK ANSWER THAT WILL GET YOU ON THE RIGHT TRACKTORRESRODRIGUEZ IN THIS EPISODE OF LIFE KIT BUCKLE UP WERE GOING TO HELP YOU WEATHER FINANCIAL TURBULENCE LIKE WHEN THE COUNTRY IS IN A RECESSION OR YOU LOSE YOUR JOB AND WELL ANSWER THOSE HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE TO TURN WHEN YOU HIT A FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN IS IT OK TO ASK FOR A LOAN AND WHAT BILLS YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE IF YOURE THINKING THIS ISNT FOR MESINGLETARY WERE COMING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW THIS CRISIS HOPEFULLY IS ENDING BUT GUESS WHAT THERES GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE AFTER IT AND YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR ITTORRESRODRIGUEZ SO GET READY FOR TAKEOFF IT MIGHT GET A LITTLE BUMPY BUT WELL HAVE A SMOOTH LANDINGSOUNDBITE OF MUSICTORRESRODRIGUEZ IN THE BOOK YOU SAY THAT YOU MANAGE YOUR MONEY LIKE YOURE IN A PERPETUAL RECESSION SO IM CURIOUS WHY YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THAT APPROACH AND HOW WE CAN LET CALCULATED CAUTION NOT TURN INTO FEAR ABOUT MONEY RIGHT BECAUSE THATS THE THING THAT SO MANY OF US ARE DEALING WITHSINGLETARY THATS EXACTLY RIGHT IN MY HEAD I HAVE TO ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST THE TIME IN WHICH I HAVE THE HARDEST TO GET PEOPLE TO SAVE IS WHEN THEYRE DOING REALLY WELL AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WHEN YOURE DOING REALLY WELL THATS THE TIME YOURE GOING TO BE SAVING AND DOING ALL THE THINGS BUT YOU JUST THINK THE HAPPY DAYS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE FOREVER AND OH I CAN GET TO THAT SAVING TOMORROW OR YEAH IM GOING TO EVENTUALLY INCREASE MY RETIREMENT ACCOUNT WHEN I DO ALL THIS OTHER STUFF BUT I NEED YOU TO CONCENTRATE RIGHT NOW ON WHAT YOU CAN DO TO BETTER YOUR FINANCES TO PREPARE FOR THAT NEXT CRISIS NOT OUT OF FEAR BUT OUT OF PREPARATIONTORRESRODRIGUEZ YEAH I LOVE THAT ADVICE SO IF SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY FACING A LAYOFF OR A FURLOUGH HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHAT BILLS SHOULD BE PAID FIRSTSINGLETARY TRADITIONALLY FINANCIAL EXPERTS SAY OH YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO PAY ALL YOUR BILLS PAY THEM ON TIME AND WE JUST DRILL THAT INTO PEOPLES HEAD UNTIL THEY LOSE THEIR JOB AND THERES SUCH LIMITED INCOME YES I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE TO PAY YOUR DEBTS BUT WHEN YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH INCOME YOU JUST PAY FOR WHAT YOU NEED  A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE AND IN SOME CASES ITS JUST THE FOOD ON THE TABLE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM TO NOT PAY YOUR RENT OR EVEN YOUR MORTGAGEAND I KNOW THAT HURTS PEOPLE THEY TRY TO PAY A LITTLE BIT ON EVERYTHING AND THEN THEY DONT HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE FOOD ON THE TABLE AND SO I NEED PEOPLE TO RELEASE THEMSELVES FROM THAT GUILT SO YOU PAY FOR THE FOOD YOU PAY KEEPING THAT CAR GOING SO YOU CAN GO LOOK FOR A JOB YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ONYOU KNOW DONT WORRY ABOUT YOUR CREDIT CARD BILL RIGHT NOW WE CAN FIX THAT LATER AND WHILE THAT IS AN OBLIGATION THAT YOU  I WANT YOU TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT WHEN YOU DONT HAVE ANY INCOMETORRESRODRIGUEZ ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES THAT PEOPLE MIGHT TURN TO FOR SUPPORT FINANCIALLY IS FRIENDS AND FAMILY SO WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO ASK FOR A LOAN VERSUS A FINANCIAL GIFTSINGLETARY SO THERE IS NEVER A RIGHT TIME TO ASK FOR A LOAN YOU SHOULDNT ASK FOR A LOAN THIS IS JUST GOING TO BLOW PEOPLE AWAY BECAUSE THEYRE JUST LIKE WHAT I GOT TO PAY THIS BACK I REALLY NEED PEOPLE TO TUCK THEIR PRIDE AND IF THEYRE IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM AND CARE FOR THEM AND SAY IVE LOST MY JOB I DONT KNOW WHEN I CAN PAY YOU BACK I DONT WANT TO MAKE A PROMISE THAT IM GOING TO BREAK AND HURT OUR RELATIONSHIP SO IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH X LISTEN I DONT HAVE ENOUGH FOR RENT AND GROCERIES I CAN COVER THE RENT CAN YOU HELP ME WITH MY GROCERIESAND YOU GOT TO COME AT PEOPLE THAT WAY AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS IN THEIR LIFE WHO SAY ABSOLUTELY BUT WE COME TO THEM WITH THE LOAN BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT OBLIGATION LIKE ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO EXCEPT WHEN YOU CANT PAY THEM BACK THEN THAT RUINS THE RELATIONSHIPAND I NEED PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT CONVERSATION TO RELIEVE PEOPLE OF THAT NEED TO PAY YOU BACK SO WHENEVER ANYBODY APPROACHES ME YOU KNOW FAMILY OR FRIENDS I SAY RIGHT AWAY THIS IS NOT A LOAN AND IF I WRITE THEM A CHECK I  ON THE MEMO LINE  AND THIS HAPPENED RECENTLY  I SAID THIS IS NOT  IN CAPITAL LETTERS  A LOAN JUST AS A REMINDER TO THEM THAT ITS OK THAT YOU CAME TO ME I HAVE THE RESOURCES IM OK WITH THAT I WOULDNT GIVE YOU WHAT I CANT AFFORD AND I RELEASE THEM OF THAT OBLIGATIONAND WE NEVER SPEAK ABOUT IT AGAIN THATS THE OTHER THING IF YOURE GOING TO DO THAT DONT KEEP BRINGING IT UP WELL YOU KNOW I HELPED YOU OUT WHEN YOU NEED TO GIVE AND FORGET BECAUSE THEN IF YOU KEEP BRINGING IT UP THE PERSON FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE TO PAY YOU BACK SO JUST DONT SAY ANYTHINGTORRESRODRIGUEZ YEAH THAT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY I THINK IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MONEY GETTING IN THE WAY OF RELATIONSHIPS OR ACTUALLY FOSTERING THEM AND MAKING THEM EVEN DEEPERSINGLETARY RIGHTTORRESRODRIGUEZ OK SO IN A PINCH  RIGHT  PEOPLE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO TURN TO PREDATORY LENDING OPTIONS LIKE PAYDAY LOANS OR TITLE LOANS WHY SHOULD WE AVOID THESE THINGS AT ALL COSTSSINGLETARY SO PAYDAY LOANS ARE LOANS THAT ARE GIVEN TO PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR NEXT PAYCHECK SO ALL YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS A PAYCHECK AND TITLE LOANS IS LIKE SAY YOUR CAR IS PAID OFF OF AND YOU USE THE TITLE AS COLLATERAL AGAINST THAT LOAN NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT SITUATION IS SAY YOUVE GOT A CAR THATS WORTH  AND YOU BORROW  BUT YOU DEFAULT ON THAT NOW THEY TAKE YOUR  CAR FOR THAT  LOAN AND THATS WHY THOSE TITLE LOANS ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUSWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FEES AND YOU ANNUALIZE THOSE FEES AND TURN THEM INTO AN INTEREST RATE WHICH YOU SHOULD  AND MANY CONSUMER ADVOCATES DO THIS  YOU WILL SEE THAT THOSE FEES TRANSLATE TO INTEREST RATES OF ANYWHERE FROM  PERCENT TO A THOUSAND PERCENT AND SO IF YOU WERE IN TROUBLE AND SOMEONE SAID HEY IM GOING LEND YOU MONEY AT  YOU WOULDNT DO ITSOUNDBITE OF MUSICSINGLETARY THINK ABOUT THIS  IF YOURE IN A JAM AND YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY NOW YOURE PLEDGING MONEY FROM YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK YOURE ALREADY BEHIND HOW ARE YOU THEN GOING TO CATCH UP AND STUDIES SHOW THAT MANY PEOPLE END UP IN A DEBT CYCLE WITH THESE LOANSTORRESRODRIGUEZ SOMETHING WE SAW WITH THE PANDEMIC WAS THE IRS ALLOWING FOLKS TO WITHDRAW MONEY OUT OF THEIR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCIES THAT CAME UP AS A RESULT OF COVID WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TAKING K LOANS OR EARLY WITHDRAWALS FROM YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET WHEN YOURE EXPERIENCING A FINANCIAL EMERGENCYSINGLETARY YEAH YOU KNOW I CAN SIT IN MY NICE CUSHY JOB IN MY HOME OFFICE HAVING NEVER LOST MY JOB TO SAY DONT DARE TOUCH THAT RETIREMENT ACCOUNT THAT IS JUST CRUEL I THINK IT IS A POT OF MONEY THAT MANY PEOPLE FELT LIKE THEY HAD TO TOUCH AS A LAST RESORT SO IN THE BOOK I TALK ABOUT WHERE TO GO BEFORE YOU REACH THAT POINT BUT IF YOUVE TAPPED EVERYBODY THAT YOU COULD OR THERE WAS NOBODY TO TAP IF YOU HAD NO SAVINGS  AND IM DEFINITELY WANT YOU TO SKIP GOING TO GET A PAYDAY LOAN  THEN THAT IS A SOURCE OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN TAP ITS NOT IDEAL ID HOPE AND PRAY THAT YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IT BUT IF YOU DO GO AHEAD AND DO IT BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO NOW DONT TAKE A LOT OF THE MONEY YOU KNOW TAKE IT YOU KNOW LITTLE BY LITTLE AS YOU NEED IT SO YOU DONT WANT TO TAKE OUT  WHEN YOU ONLY REALLY NEED A THOUSANDTORRESRODRIGUEZ CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT ORDER OF SUCCESSION WHEN IT COMES TO WHO YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO WHAT RESOURCES YOU SHOULD BE ACCESSING WHEN YOURE IN A FINANCIAL CRISISSINGLETARY YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL GO THROUGH ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS  ALL OF IT RIGHT BECAUSE THATS WHY ITS THERE AND THEN YOU GO TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND DO JUST WHAT I SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW ASK THEM TO HELP YOU OUT AND THEN YOU KNOW COMMUNITY GROUPS CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW MANY OF CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FUNDS THAT THEY SET ASIDE FOR MEMBERS IN NEED AND THEN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IF NECESSARY APPLY FOR WELFARE MEDICAID  USE THOSE RESOURCES THATS WHAT THEYRE THERE FORIF ALL OF THATS NOT AVAILABLE THEN YOU CAN TAP IF YOU HAVE IT YOUR RETIREMENT FUNDS ITS GOING TO COST YOU BUT ITS THERE AND IM NOT EVEN GOING TO MENTION THOSE OTHER THINGS CAUSE I DONT EVEN WANT YOU TO GET DOWN TO PAYDAY AND TITLE LOANS I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE THOSE OFF THE LIST COMPLETELYTORRESRODRIGUEZ SO YOU MENTIONED SAVINGS AND I THINK THERES A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT IS AN EMERGENCY FUND ENOUGH AS FAR AS SAVINGS RIGHT BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SAVE FOR WHAT DO WE DO HOW MANY TYPES OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH EMERGENCIESSINGLETARY SO I LIKE TO JOKE THAT IM A POT PERSON LAUGHTER BUT NOT THAT KIND OF POT LAUGHTER I LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY IN DIFFERENT SAVINGS POTS IT IS A WAY TO ORGANIZE MY SAVINGS AND ALSO PREVENT ME FROM TAPPING MONEY THAT I SHOULDNT BE TAPPINGAND SO I HAVE AN EMERGENCY POT I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A LIFE HAPPENS POT WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE EMERGENCY FUND BECAUSE THE EMERGENCY FUND THATS YOUR DIRE THATS  FUND THAT IS THE MONEY  YOUVE LOST YOUR JOB YOUVE HAD INCOME DISRUPTION THATS LIKE THE EMERGENCY EMERGENCY HATCH RIGHTAND LIFE HAPPENS IS THE POT OF MONEY WHEN LIFE HAPPENS YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN IF YOUVE GOT KIDS THEYRE GOING TO BREAK SOMETHING YOU KNOW THATS THE POT THAT YOU REACH FOR IN THOSE SITUATIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DONT HAVE THE EMERGENCY FUNDS WHEN THEY GET IN A CRISIS BECAUSE THEYVE BEEN DIPPING INTO ITI CALL IT REALLY A SLUSH FUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW MONEY SLUSHES IN MONEY SLUSHES OUT AND THEN ITS NOT THERE WHEN YOU TRULY NEED IT AND SO THATS WHERE THE LIFE HAPPENS POT COMES FROM IF YOURE SUPER DISCIPLINED YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN ONE POT THATS FINE IM NOT EVEN LIKE THAT SO IF IM NOT LIKE THAT LAUGHTER I THINK YOU MERE MORTALS SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF POTS LAUGHTERTORRESRODRIGUEZ WHATS YOUR TAKE ON THE TYPE OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT SHOULD WE BE USING HIGHYIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS IT OK TO JUST USE YOUR LOCAL BANK OR CREDIT UNION WHATS YOUR OPINION ON THATSINGLETARY THATS SUCH A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME IVE GOT ALL THIS MONEY  YOU KNOW THEYRE VERY FORTUNATE  IN AN EMERGENCY FUND BUT IT JUST IS NOT EARNING ANYTHING AND I JUST GO AND BECAUSE LISTEN THATS NOT THAT MONEYS PURPOSE THAT MONEYS PURPOSE IS JUST TO BE THERE AND RIGHT NOW INTEREST RATES ARE JUST CRAZY LOW RIGHT YOU JUST  YOU ALMOST HAVE TO PAY THE BANK TO HOLD YOUR MONEYDONT WORRY ABOUT THAT ITS JOB IS TO BE THERE RISKFREE IM NOT TRYING TO GROW THE PRINCIPAL IM JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE ITS THERE IF I NEED IT NOW I DO YOU KNOW SEARCH FOR IT AND MAKE SURE THAT IM INVESTING AND GETTING GROWTH IN MY OTHER POTS OF MONEY LIKE MY RETIREMENT ACCOUNT LIKE MY CHILDRENS COLLEGE FUND  THOSE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CERTAINLY CAN YOU KNOW SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE YOURE YOU KNOW TRYING TO EARN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BUT DONT WORRY ABOUT WHAT THOSE OTHER POTS ARE EARNINGTORRESRODRIGUEZ ALL RIGHT LETS TALK ABOUT FINANCIAL SCAMS AND SCHEMES I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME I TURN ON THE NEWS THERES SOME NEW THING THAT WE HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMMON SCHEMES THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FORSINGLETARY WELL RIGHT NOW IN MANY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY MINORITY COMMUNITIES THERES PONZI AND PYRAMID SCHEMES SO THE BIG THING IS LIKE THE SUSU WHICH IS SORT OF A SAVINGS TECHNIQUE THAT MANY IMMIGRANTS USE WHERE PEOPLE POOL THEIR MONEY AND SOMEBODY GETS YOU KNOW THE POT OF SAVINGS EVERY MONTH BUT NOW PEOPLE HAVE USED THAT TO CREATE THESE PYRAMID SCHEMES WHERE  SAY YOU PUT IN  AND THEY PROMISE YOU  NOW YOU KNOW THATS A SCAM COME ON NOW IF THEY SAY I CAN GUARANTEE YOU A RETURN YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE SCAMMED YOU KNOW IF THEY SAY I GOT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE KNOWS TOO YOURE ABOUT TO BE SCAMMEDAND SO JUST  YOU KNOW JUST PAUSE AND IF YOU JUST PAUSE AND DO DUE DILIGENCE YOULL FIND THAT YOU WONT BE SCAMMED BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE TRUST FOLKS BECAUSE SAY YOUR SISTER BRINGS THEM TO YOU OR YOUR UNCLE OR EVEN YOUR PASTOR I DONT TRUST NOBODY I DONT EVEN TRUST MY HUSBAND IF HE BROUGHT SOMETHING ME IM LIKE DUDE IM CHECKING THIS OUT I SLEEP WITH YOU BUT IM CHECKING THIS OUT LAUGHTER YOU KNOWAND THATS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO BECAUSE THE SCAMMERS KNOW THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEYRE BEHIND THE CURVE THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GROW THEIR MONEY THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE BEHIND IN SAVINGS AND SO THEYRE EAGER TO FIND A QUICK FIX A QUICK WAY TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY PLAY ON THAT THEY PLAY ON YOUR TRUST YOU KNOW DONT GIVE ANYBODY ANY INFORMATION WHO INITIATED A CALL TO YOU JUST TRUST NO ONETORRESRODRIGUEZ YEAH EXCELLENT ADVICE SO IF YOURE FINDING YOURSELF RIGHT NOW IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS WHAT ARE YOUR TOP TIPS FOR PREPARING HANDLING AND GETTING THROUGH THAT EMERGENCYSINGLETARY THE NO  TIP I HAVE IS TO FORGIVE YOURSELF RIGHT YOU FEEL SO GUILTY YOU HEAR ME SAY ALL THIS STUFF AND YOURE LIKE I DIDNT DO NONE OF THAT STUFF I DONT WANT  THATS NOT WHAT I WANT I DONT WANT YOU TO FEEL GUILTY I WANT YOU TO FEEL ENERGIZED I WANT YOU TO FEEL MOTIVATED IM TRYING TO MOTIVATE YOU IM NOT GOING TO BEAT YOU ON THE HEAD YOU DID WHAT YOU DID AND MAYBE YOU DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING THATS OK BUT ONCE YOU KNOW BETTER I NEED YOU TO DO BETTER RIGHT THATS THE THING YOURE LISTENING TO ME IM GIVING YOU SOME GREAT TIPS DONT JUST SAY OH THATS RIGHT AND THEN GO BACK AND DO THE SAME THINGAND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT TAKE IT SLOW YEAH IM TELLING YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF MONEY AND DISCIPLINE BUT IF YOU CAN ONLY SAVE  JUST SAVE  IF YOU CAN ONLY SAVE  JUST SAVE  YOULL JUST BE BETTER FOR IT AND ONCE YOU DEVELOP THAT HABIT AT THE LOWER LEVELS WHEN YOU START TO MAKE MONEY OR YOU GET BACK ON TRACK THEN ITLL BECOME EASIER BECAUSE YOU GOT MORE MONEY AT HANDTORRESRODRIGUEZ YEAH I THINK ITS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER THAT NOTHING BAD LASTS FOREVER AND IF YOURE PREPARED NEXT TIME AROUND  BECAUSE

SIMPLY DOESNT HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH WHO IS IN OFFICE  THE GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE SOME LIMITED LEVERS TO TRY TO ADJUST PRICES PRESIDENT JOE BIDENS ANNOUNCEMENT OF A MASSIVE RELEASE OF OIL FROM THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE EARLIER THIS YEAR DID MOVE MARKETS  TEMPORARILY  BUT OVERWHELMINGLY PRICES ARE SET BY THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND HERES WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW  WHATS DRIVING PRICES DOWN RIGHT NOW  TWO MAIN FORCES ARE SENDING PRICES DOWN ONE IS AN IMPROVING REFINERY SITUATION LAST MONTH OUTAGES AT REFINERIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST AND THE GREAT LAKES AREA SENT PRICES IN SOME REGIONS SKYROCKETING  WE WERE SEEING EVERY DAY GAS PRICES INCREASE BY   SOMETIMES  CENTS A GALLON REMEMBERED ANLLEYN VENEGAS A SAN DIEGOBASED AAA SPOKESWOMAN  NOW REFINERIES ARE COMING BACK ONLINE AND THE SUPPLY OF GASOLINE IS GOING UP WHICH IN TURN IS PUSHING PRICES DOWN  MEANWHILE AUTUMN HAS ARRIVED THAT MEANS LIKE CLOCKWORK PUMPKIN SPICE HAS TAKEN OVER THE GROCERY AISLE COLORFUL LEAVES HAVE TAKEN OVER INSTAGRAM  AND DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HAS STARTED TO DECREASE AMERICANS DRIVE LESS WHEN ITS COLDER AND GAS PRICES ALMOST ALWAYS GO DOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR ADD THOSE TOGETHER AND YOU GET PRICES DROPPING EVERY DAY SINCE OCT  WHAT ABOUT BIDENS RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANOTHER RELEASE FROM THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVES  THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MORE OF AN UPDATE ABOUT THE BIG RELEASE ANNOUNCED THIS SPRING NO NEW BARRELS OF OIL WERE INVOLVED IT WASNT A NEW ANNOUNCEMENT SAYS PATRICK DE HAAN OF THE PRICE TRACKING APP GASBUDDY THE MARKET HAD BEEN EXPECTING THAT  ITS REALLY NOT MOVING THE NEEDLE MUCH  THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TRYING TO MOVE PRICES DOWN IN ADDITION TO THAT UPDATE ON THE SPR RELEASE IT ALSO PLEDGED TO REFILL THE STRATEGIC RESERVES IF PRICES FALL AN ATTEMPT TO INCENTIVIZE DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCERS TO PUMP MORE OIL BY GIVING THEM A GUARANTEED BUYER  EARLIER IT ATTEMPTED TO PRACTICE OIL DIPLOMACY AND COAX SAUDI ARABIA INTO BOOSTING PRODUCTION BUT THE SAUDIS AND THEIR ALLIES DID THE OPPOSITE WITH A MAJOR PRODUCTION CUT EARLIER THIS MONTH  THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ALSO EXCORIATED OIL COMPANIES FOR NOT KEEPING ENOUGH OIL IN INVENTORY AND THREATENED EXPORT BANS THE INDUSTRY WARNS SUCH BANS WOULD BACKFIRE BADLY  NONE OF THOSE EFFORTS CAN REALLY BE CREDITED FOR TODAYS FALLING PRICES   BUSINESS GASOLINE PRICES ARE SURGING CAN BIDEN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT ITTHIS IS A LONGSTANDING FRUSTRATION FOR WHOEVER IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE POLITICIANS ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR GASOLINE PRICES THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED TOOLS FOR ACTUALLY AFFECTING THOSE PRICES AND THE TOOLS THEY DO HAVE DONT WORK SUPER WELL  WHAT ABOUT THE CLIMATE POLICY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SET HAS THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN PUSHING PRICES UP  THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS WE NEED MORE OIL IN THE SHORT TERM TO MEET ENERGY NEEDS BUT LESS OIL IN THE LONG TERM TO REDUCE THE CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OIL EXECUTIVES DO NOT LIKE THAT MESSAGE AND SAY IT MAKES IT HARDER TO PLAN INVESTMENTS  HOWEVER AS THE WHITE HOUSE TAKES PAINS TO NOTE CURRENT FEDERAL POLICY IS NOT BLOCKING PRODUCTION THERES NO DRILLING BAN IN PLACE SO WHY IS US PRODUCTION LOWER THAN IT MIGHT BE THERES A TUGOFWAR GOING ON BETWEEN INCENTIVES TO DRILL MORE OIL AND INCENTIVES TO DRILL LESS ON THE MORE OIL SIDE YOU HAVE THE PROFIT A COMPANY CAN MAKE ON EACH NEW BARREL IT DRILLS ON THE LESS OIL SIDE YOU HAVE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS LABOR SHORTAGES INVESTORS WHO ARE ENJOYING HIGH OIL PRICES AND FEARS OF A GLOBAL RECESSION AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LONGTERM CLIMATE POLICIES  COULD THE GOVERNMENT DO MORE TO SET ENERGY PRICES  SOME GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD SIMPLY OWN OIL PRODUCTION WITHIN THEIR BORDERS OUTRIGHT AND SET FUEL PRICES FOR THEIR CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF MARKET PRICES THINK OF VENEZUELA OR IRAN THE US ECONOMY IS INTENTIONALLY SET UP VERY DIFFERENTLY   EUROPE THE EUROPEAN UNION FACES A BATTLE TO KEEP ENERGY PRICES FROM HARMING ITS ECONOMYHOWEVER IN EUROPE  IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES MUCH MORE LIKE THE US  GOVERNMENTS ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING SOME FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED INTERVENTIONS INTO ENERGY MARKETS THE WAR IN UKRAINE HAS SENT NATURAL GAS PRICES HAYWIRE POLITICIANS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF HEATING ELECTRICITY AND FUEL AND THEYRE LOOKING AT WINDFALL TAXES TO CLAW BACK PROFITS FROM ENERGY COMPANIES AND REBATES AND PRICE CAPS TO CUT COSTS FOR

GASOLINE PRICES WHICH HIT A RECORD HIGH EARLIER THIS SUMMER HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS THEY ARE NOW BELOW  A GALLON IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY EVEN AS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE REMAINS ABOVE THAT LEVEL THATS A RELIEF FOR DRIVERS  AND FOR INFLATION WHICH HIT A FOURDECADE HIGH IN JUNE  HOW MUCH HAVE PRICES FALLEN ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION THE AVERAGE PRICE OF GASOLINE NATIONWIDE WAS  ON SATURDAY THATS DOWN NEARLY A DOLLAR SINCE MIDJUNE WHEN PUMP PRICES HIT AN ALLTIME HIGH OF  PER GALLON  SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY LIKE TEXAS HAVE SEEN AN EVEN SHARPER DECLINE PROVIDING RELIEF FOR DRIVERS WHO HAD SEEN PRICES SURGE EARLIER THIS YEAR FOLLOWING  RUSSIAS INVASION OF UKRAINE I FILLED UP YESTERDAY AND IT WAS  SO YEAH I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THAT SAYS LINDA MCDANIEL WHO DRIVES  MILES EVERY DAY TO HER JOB IN SAN ANTONIO BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH A COMMUTE I DRIVE A HONDA CIVIC WHICH GETS PRETTY GOOD GAS MILEAGE BUT WITH THOSE BIGGER PRICES IT WAS REALLY COSTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MORE TO FILL UP MY TANK WHATS BEHIND THE SHARP DROP IN GASOLINE PRICES  ITS PARTLY A FUNCTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND  WHEN PUMP PRICES TOPPED  A GALLON DRIVERS ADJUSTED THEIR BEHAVIOR TRYING TO LIMIT HOW MUCH THEY DROVE THEY CARPOOLED COMBINED ERRANDS AND CUT OUT UNNECESSARY TRIPS   BUSINESS THE ASTRONOMICAL PRICE OF DIESEL IS MAKING EVERYTHING MORE EXPENSIVEMCDANIEL ACTUALLY CANCELED A ROAD TRIP TO COLORADO THIS SUMMER  GASOLINE CONSUMPTION IN THE US HAS BEEN ABOUT  LOWER IN RECENT WEEKS THAN IT WAS LAST SUMMER  A PRETTY DRAMATIC DROP IN DEMAND  AT THE SAME TIME DOMESTIC CRUDE OIL SUPPLY HAS INCREASED MORE THAN  FROM A YEAR AGO GROWING CONCERN ABOUT AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AROUND THE WORLD HAS ALSO WEIGHED ON CRUDE OIL PRICES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT HALF THE COST OF GASOLINE  ALL OF THIS IS A RECIPE FOR LOWER PRICES AT THE PUMP  AMERICANS COLLECTIVELY ARE GOING TO SPEND  MILLION LESS ON GASOLINE TODAY THAN THEY DID ON JUNE TH WHEN PRICES PEAKED SAYS PETROLEUM

AND THE COST OF THINGS  THE FALL IN GAS PRICES WILL CERTAINLY HELP IN TERMS OF THE COST OF LIVING ANNUAL INFLATION IN JUNE HIT  THE HIGHEST SINCE LATE  AND GASOLINE PRICES HAVE BEEN A BIG DRIVER OF THAT INCREASE  THE PROBLEM IS THAT OTHER PRICES HAVE BEEN CLIMBING TOO INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE STICKIER THAN GASOLINE WHICH TENDS TO BOUNCE UP AND DOWN   MCDANIEL FOR EXAMPLE RENTS A COUPLE OF STORAGE UNITS AND SAYS THE RENT HAS INCREASED BY  A MONTH SHES ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HER UTILITY BILL SINCE HER AIR CONDITIONER HAS BEEN WORKING OVERTIME IN THE TEXAS HEAT  ITS BEEN IN THE S SINCE MAY MCDANIEL SAYS SO THE ELECTRICITY BILLS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THIS WORLD  ECONOMY NO RETREAT IN THE SUMMER HEAT INFLATION BLISTERING AT  IN JUNESO FAR CONSUMERS HAVE SEEN LITTLE BREAK IN THE COST OF GROCERIES OR HOUSING BOTH OF WHICH ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER SHARE OF THE TYPICAL FAMILY BUDGET THAN GASOLINE  SO WHILE MANY DRIVERS WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR CHEAPER GASOLINE ITS NOT A CUREALL FOR INFLATION  YES IT IS WELCOME RELIEF MCDANIEL SAYS OF GAS PRICES BUT I MEAN YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE INFLATION IN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING LIKE IN OUR SODA MACHINE THE PRICE WENT UP  CENTS OVERNIGHT JUST EVERY LITTLE THING YOU NOTICE GOES UP EVEN A PACK OF GUM WENT UP  CENTS WHERE DO GAS PRICES GO FROM HERE  PUMP PRICES COULD FALL FURTHER IN THE NEAR TERM BUT ITS HARDER TO SAY WHAT WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS YEAR DE HAAN THE GASBUDDY ANALYST PREDICTS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF GASOLINE NATIONWIDE WILL DROP BELOW  A GALLON IN THE COMING DAYS  BUT HE WARNS THERE ARE SOME WILD CARDS OUT THERE A HURRICANE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE COULD KNOCK OUT DRILLING RIGS OR REFINERIES CRIMPING GASOLINE SUPPLIES  GEOPOLITICAL THREATS IN EUROPE OR ASIA COULD ALSO SEND GAS PRICES CLIMBING AGAIN  ALL THAT MAKES IT HARD TO SAY IF THE

BUT WHAT ARE HEAT PUMPS AND WHY DO SOME CALL THEM A KEY CLIMATE SOLUTION HERE ARE THE ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST BURNING HEAT PUMP QUESTIONS WHAT IS A HEAT PUMP AND HOW DOES IT WORK THE NAME HEAT PUMP IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER SAYS KEVIN KIRCHER ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE CENTER FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE BUILDINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE DISLIKE THE NAME HEAT PUMP RIGHT CAUSE IT DOESNT REALLY CONVEY YOU KNOW THE FULL RANGE OF WHAT THE MACHINE CAN DO HE SAYS  HEAT PUMPS CAN WORK FOR BOTH HEATING AND COOLING KIRCHER SAYS YOU CAN THINK OF A HEAT PUMP AS AN AIR CONDITIONER THAT CAN ALSO WORK BACKWARDS THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT MACHINES USE ELECTRICITY AND REFRIGERANTS TO COOL AIR ON HOT DAYS  IN THE WINTER EVEN IF THE OUTDOOR AIR IS COLD ITS STILL NORMALLY WARMER THAN THE REFRIGERANT INSIDE THE HEAT PUMP KIRCHER SAYS SO THE REFRIGERANT CAN ABSORB BITS OF HEAT FROM THE OUTDOOR AIR AND BRING IT INSIDE TO WARM YOUR HOME WHAT ARE THE CLIMATE BENEFITS OF HEAT PUMPS THE FACT THAT HEAT PUMPS USE ELECTRICITY IS A BIG REASON WHY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD SEE THEM AS A KEY CLIMATE SOLUTION SAYS YANNICK MONSCHAUER ENERGY ANALYST AT THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY IN PARIS THATS BECAUSE HEAT PUMPS CAN REPLACE GAS FURNACES AND THE ELECTRICITY THEY RUN ON IS INCREASINGLY POWERED BY RENEWABLES MONSCHAUER SAYS REDUCING GAS USAGE IN HOMES ALSO REDUCES LEAKS OF METHANE A POTENT PLANETHEATING GAS FOSSIL FUELBASED HEATING STILL ACCOUNTED FOR  OF GLOBAL HEATING EQUIPMENT SALES IN  BUT IF GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE US AND THE EUROPEAN UNION MEET THE TARGETS LAID OUT IN CLIMATE LEGISLATION LIKE THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND REPOWEREU HEAT PUMPS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY SLASH PLANETHEATING FOSSIL FUEL USE IN BUILDINGS MONSCHAUER SAYS WE SEE THAT HEAT PUMPS COULD BRING DOWN GLOBAL CO EMISSIONS BY HALF A GIGATON BY THE END OF THIS DECADE HE SAYS SO THAT IS COMPARABLE TO THE ANNUAL EMISSIONS OF CANADA ENLARGE THIS IMAGE                JAMES TUCKER WITH HIS

CLIMATE LEGISLATION OFFERS NEW ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR HOMEOWNERS TO INSTALL HEAT PUMPS SAYS STEVEN NADEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR AN ENERGYEFFICIENT ECONOMY A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION WORKING ON SAVING ENERGY AN IRS SPOKESPERSON TELLS NPR THAT THE NEW CREDITS CAN TRANSLATE TO UP TO  FOR EFFICIENT HEAT PUMPS BOUGHT AFTER JANUARY   IF YOU BUY A NEW HEAT PUMP NADEL SAYS TO KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS FOR REFERENCE FOR NEXT YEARS TAX SEASON IF YOU BOUGHT A HEAT PUMP IN  YOU CAN GET CREDIT FOR THIS UPCOMING TAX SEASON BUT THE PREVIOUS INCENTIVE WAS SMALLER UP TO  THE IRS SAYS  SOME STATES AND SOME UTILITIES ALSO GIVE REBATES FOR EFFICIENT HEAT PUMPS NADEL SAYS YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH YOUR UTILITY TO SEE IF THERE ARE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA  AS FOR RENTERS ITS ALSO POSSIBLE TO GET CREDITS FOR APPLIANCES LIKE EFFICIENT HEAT PUMPS ACCORDING TO THE IRS  DO HEAT PUMPS ACTUALLY WORK IN COLD TEMPERATURES EARLIER GENERATIONS OF HEAT PUMPS DIDNT WORK AS EFFICIENTLY IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES BUT MONSCHAUER SAYS THERES BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY IN THE COLDEST PARTS OF EUROPE WE ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST SHARES OF HEAT PUMPS SO IN NORWAY FOR EXAMPLE  OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE EQUIPPED WITH HEAT PUMPS AND IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND IT IS ALSO  SO ITS DEFINITELY PROVEN THAT ITS POSSIBLE THE HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS COMMONLY FOUND IN SCANDINAVIAN HOMES DO NOT NEED TO RUN ON BACKUP FOSSIL FUELS MONSCHAUER SAYS  NOT ALL HEAT PUMPS SOLD IN THE US WORK WELL IN THE COLDEST WEATHER ITS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CONSULT WITH AN INSTALLER WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH HEAT PUMPS AND MAKE SURE TO FIND A MACHINE THATS MOST EFFICIENT FOR YOUR WEATHER NADEL SAYS  IN A COLD CLIMATE THAT GETS BELOW  DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FAIRLY OFTEN YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO GETTING INTO AN ENERGY STAR COLD

JULIA SIMONNPR                    CAN HEAT PUMPS SAVE MONEY BECAUSE HEAT PUMPS MOVE HEAT AROUND INSTEAD OF BURNING FOSSIL FUELS FOR HEAT THEY ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN GAS FURNACES AND WHILE HEAT PUMPS ARE TYPICALLY MORE EXPENSIVE ON THE FRONT END THE SAVINGS COME OVER TIME WHEN YOU END UP SPENDING LESS ON GAS SAYS BRIAN REES A HEAT PUMP INSTALLER AT BRYANT AIR CONDITIONING  HEATING COMPANY IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA REES SAYS THE COST SAVINGS ARE WHAT ATTRACT HIS CUSTOMERS TO HEAT PUMPS ITS MORE ABOUT HITTING THEIR POCKETBOOK HE SAYS ITS MORE ABOUT WHATS GOING TO SAVE THEM MONEY IN THE LONG RUN AND HEAT PUMPS WILL DO THAT KIRCHER SAYS YOU CAN ALSO SAVE MONEY IF YOU CAN BUY A HEAT PUMP FOR BOTH YOUR HEATING AND COOLING NEEDS ITS TYPICALLY CHEAPER THAN BUYING A GAS FURNACE PLUS AN AIR CONDITIONER HE SAYS  ARE THERE DOWNSIDES TO HEAT PUMPS LIKE REFRIGERATORS OR AIR CONDITIONERS HEAT PUMPS USE REFRIGERANTS THE PRIMARY REFRIGERANTS COMMONLY USED IN HEAT PUMPS ARE CALLED HYDROFLUOROCARBONS OR HFCS SAYS DUNCAN CALLAWAY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES AT UC BERKELEY THESE HFCS HAVE HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL IF THEYRE RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE CALLAWAY SAYS THATS WHY ITS CRITICAL THAT HEAT PUMP INSTALLERS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE REFRIGERANTS DONT LEAK AND ARE DISPOSED OF PROPERLY HE SAYS  WE NEED WELLTRAINED TECHNICIANS THAT SORT OF UNDERSTAND THE
