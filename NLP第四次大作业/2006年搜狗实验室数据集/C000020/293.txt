　　求职信也是简历中的一个重要组成。我们已经介绍过英语求职信应包括的几个要素， 
但是不同类型求职信的写作有不同的特点，因此我们将推出一个求职信的系列范文供大家参考。
　　下面是一封经由熟人介绍、申请职位的求职信。
　　Dear Mr. Morgan,
　　Fillip Stiller advised me of a foreman position that's available at your 
company. From my enclosed résumé, you will find that my experience meets the 
requirements you've outlined for the position.
　　As the former manager of a small business, I appreciate the importance of a 
following that comes from the recommendations of satisfied clients. I am 
considered a diplomatic manager, which enables me to get along well with 
clients, supervisors, and staff. My ability to maintain high morale among 
workers increases retention and contributes to safety, a crucial factor in the 
success of construction work.
　　I would welcome the opportunity for a personal interview with you at your 
convenience.
　　Sincerely,
　　Allan Everson
