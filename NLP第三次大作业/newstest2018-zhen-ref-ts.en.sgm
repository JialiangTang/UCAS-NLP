<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”</seg>
<seg id="2">Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.</seg>
<seg id="6">Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”</seg>
<seg id="7">According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="8">Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."</seg>
<seg id="9">According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.</seg>
<seg id="10">Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.</seg>
<seg id="11">Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”</seg>
<seg id="13">According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="16">The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="20">Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.</seg>
<seg id="21">Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."</seg>

<seg id="2">Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.</seg>
<seg id="4">*This article is taken from Wallstreetcn (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wallstreetcn APP. *</seg>
<seg id="5">As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.</seg>
<seg id="6">A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.</seg>
<seg id="9">(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)</seg>
<seg id="10">The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.</seg>
<seg id="11">Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.</seg>
<seg id="12">North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="15">From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.</seg>
<seg id="16">Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).</seg>
<seg id="17">This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.</seg>
<seg id="18">The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.</seg>
<seg id="22">The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="45">Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="46">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.</seg>
<seg id="2">Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.</seg>
<seg id="3">In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.</seg>
<seg id="4">In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.</seg>
<seg id="6">In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.</seg>
<seg id="2">Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.</seg>
<seg id="4">In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.</seg>

<seg id="21">The future and the destinies of the citizens of every country in the world are increasingly linked.</seg>
<seg id="22">People of all countries in the world should uphold the concept of one world, understand each other, seek common grounds while reserving differences,</seg>
<seg id="23">and work together to make efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.</seg>

<seg id="32">We need to accomplish our own tasks well, which itself is a contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must also create more opportunities for the world by promoting China's development.</seg>
<seg id="34">We do not import foreign models nor export the Chinese model, and we will not ask other countries to copy Chinese practices.</seg>

<seg id="421">There is a lot of frustration behind all innovations in this area,</seg>

<seg id="430">They went deeply into the grassroots mass art museums, local academies and some colleges and universities in Inner Mongolia, as well as Heilongjiang and Gansu provinces to conduct a profound interpretation of the new cultural mission</seg>
<seg id="431">I am deeply proud and happy, and I am willing to go down and write more about the fate of the normal people in the major times.</seg>
<seg id="432">on the development of grassroots literature and art.</seg>
<seg id="433">Nowadays mass literature and art are very popular, there is a little popularity,</seg>
<seg id="434">and continue to launch quality works worthy of the times.</seg>
<seg id="435">It should be rooted at grassroots and in-depth lives, with a certain substance of culture that is positive, with long-lasting artistic works that hold charm.</seg>
<seg id="436">The actual contracted area has reached 1.52 billion mu, of which 1.11 billion mu has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="437">This accounted for 82 percent of the farmland contracted by second-tier families. 7 provinces and autonomous regions including Sichuan have completed the report to the Party Central Committee and State Council at a basic level.</seg>
<seg id="438">It is estimated that by the end of 2018, the confirmation of the country’s contracted land will be completed at a basic level.</seg>

<seg id="440">The first satellite in China's space science satellite series and the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite, Wukong,</seg>
<seg id="441">conducted four scans of an area all-day in the past two years during orbit and detected more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles. It obtained the most accurate</seg>
<seg id="442">This achievement has recently been published in Nature, an international academic journal.</seg>
<seg id="443">In space, we observe that such a new observation that has not been observed before, which cannot be explained or illustrated by existing theories,</seg>
<seg id="444">The significance of this result is diverse. Above all, it shows the ability of Chinese scientists to use the most cutting-edge technologies</seg>
<seg id="445">to make scientific instruments to probe a very difficult scientific issue.</seg>
<seg id="446">Find the toilet by the nose, in the last century, this is memory that many Chinese are fond of.</seg>
<seg id="447">but also incorporates more humanized designs.</seg>
<seg id="448">impressed so many tourists. The toilet has ventilation all year around without a peculiar smell.</seg>
<seg id="449">We no longer need to rely on the nose to find the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="450">We should not only change the hardware, but the software must also keep up.</seg>
<seg id="451">The tourism department requires that toilets at famous sites should be equipped with toilet paper and hand sanitizer.</seg>
<seg id="452">But in some areas,</seg>
<seg id="453">Whether to stop this convenient service or not due to the uncivilized behavior of individuals</seg>
<seg id="454">Was decided by managers from all areas who have made their choice.</seg>
<seg id="455">On the one hand, through civilized prompts to promote conservation, on the other hand, they also carry out technological innovation.</seg>
<seg id="456">In public toilets in places like Nanjing and Sucheng in Jiangsu Province,</seg>
<seg id="457">by scanning your face for three seconds, you can get a free copy of the toilet paper, but if you want to get double copies, you need to wait ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="458">This avoids the abuse of public resources.</seg>
<seg id="459">habits. Some tourists may indeed think of taking the paper back, but on the other hand, we must reflect on this situation.</seg>
<seg id="460">Is there paper in the next toilet for tourists to use? This is what we highlighted in the new three-year plan.</seg>
<seg id="461">To solve this problem of inadequacy and imbalance</seg>
<seg id="462">and to push the revolution in toilets further, we should think more of what the masses think.</seg>
<seg id="463">to have a third toilet to facilitate family members to accompany the elderly and children to the restroom.</seg>
<seg id="464">We take our baby to the men’s room and we are embarrassed,</seg>
<seg id="465">but when w go to the ladies’ room, babies are so small that we also feel a bit embarrassed. That board is particularly comfortable, it is convenient for those who have children.</seg>
<seg id="466">people feel more civilized and have become civilized builders. In the villages, villagers in Hechi, Guangxi, are creating flushing toilets in their homes,</seg>
<seg id="467">Great achievements have been made and the active promotion of the toilet revolution does not only help people stay away from disease, but also promotes economic development to narrow the regional development gap.</seg>
<seg id="468">This toilet problem is an issue of expository themes, it is a node of the social development.</seg>
<seg id="469">It is a national civilized project that leads from the national point of view to the layout, and then takes part in all aspects to solve the small social problems with varying degrees of participation.</seg>
<seg id="470">In this way, we can make up for all shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="471">With the recent commencement of construction of Jinxi Irrigation District in Heilongjiang Province, this year began with a major water conservancy project across the country and has reached 14 items.</seg>
<seg id="472">The investment scale reached 900 billion yuan.</seg>

<seg id="474">Xicheng High Speed Rail that Links the High Speed Rail between Xi’an and Chengdu was launched on December 6, with tickets for the first train being sold and then scheduled the train after the diagram adjustment at the end of the year that is available today.</seg>
<seg id="475">At noon today, China successfully sent the No.1 land survey satellite into scheduled orbit using the Long March II Ding carrier rocket at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.</seg>
<seg id="476">Yellow River’s first public railway tunnel construction started a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="477">The tunnel is 3.7 kilometers in length and will be under direct access to the Yellow River to establish a direct link to the main urban areas of Jinan city</seg>

<seg id="479">Next up, a look at international news.</seg>
<seg id="480">On the 2nd, after voting, the US Senate has passed a massive tax cut bill.</seg>
<seg id="481">Analysts say it marks the Trump administration and Republican congressional parliament a step closer to completing the nation's largest tax relief program in three decades.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Republican-majority Senate ultimately passed the tax cut as a result of 51 votes in favor and 49 against it.</seg>
<seg id="483">and for the middle class.</seg>
<seg id="484">Democrats, on the other hand, have criticized the bill as benefiting large corporations and the rich in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="485">On the 2nd, U.S. President Trump welcomed the Senate voting to pass the tax cut bill</seg>
<seg id="486">and stressed that all economic measures by the government are boosting the U.S. economy.</seg>
<seg id="487">At the same time, Trump also criticized that it is a mistake for Democratic members of the Senate</seg>
<seg id="488">to vote against the bill.</seg>
<seg id="489">According to the U.S. legislative process, the two chambers will still reach a final unified version of the tax reduction bill in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="490">And then voted separately before</seg>
<seg id="491">According to a spokesman for the Yemeni Houthis armed forces and former President Saleh, the fighting between the two sides on the 2nd in the capital, Sana, has become more severe. Now, it has resulted in the death of 80 people.</seg>
<seg id="492">Over 100 people were wounded. According to witnesses, both parties in the conflict dispatched heavy weapons such as tanks and started fighting on the streets of Sana, leaving thousands of people, including children, trapped in the central part of Sana.</seg>
<seg id="493">Currently, the Republican Guard supporting Saleh is also occupying the airport.</seg>
<seg id="494">The presidential palace and some important government agencies announced the imposition of a curfew in the occupied territories.</seg>
<seg id="495">The Houthis armed forces claimed to have taken control of today's television station, which belonged to Saleh.</seg>
<seg id="496">Houthis armed forces and Saleh formed an alliance in late 2014 to fight the legitimate government led by Yemeni President Hady.</seg>
<seg id="497">In September this year, the Houthis Armed Forces announced the appointment of military commanders and other senior positions.</seg>
<seg id="498">Saleh refused to recognize the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="499">In late November, sporadic fighting started between Saleh supporters and the Houthis Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="500">At the same time, former Yemeni President Saleh said that</seg>
<seg id="501">he was ready to open a new chapter of relations with the multinational coalition led by Saudi Arabia and begin to work with the coalition forces in a positive way</seg>
<seg id="502">However, the premise is that the multinational coalition should stop the attack on Yemen first.</seg>
<seg id="503">In response, the multinational coalition headed by Saudi Arabia issued a statement that</seg>
<seg id="504">On the 2nd, U.S. President Trump said his campaign team has absolutely no collusion with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="505">This is Trump’s first response to the Russian investigation after Flynn, the former</seg>
<seg id="506">Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, admitted perjury.</seg>
<seg id="507">Trump also said he is not worried about what Flynn will say to investigators.</seg>
<seg id="508">On the 1st, Flynn admitted to the judge that he had committed perjury with the FBI on personal contact with Russia and</seg>
<seg id="509">He has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the German government’s acceptance of immigrants and even stated through right-wing rhetoric that Germany should be proud of veterans in World War II.</seg>
<seg id="510">A large number of local people gathered outside the venue of the conference to protest. They strongly opposed the far-right populism advocated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="511">In September this year, during the German federal election, the Select Party was elected to become the third largest party in the House.</seg>
<seg id="512">This is the first time that Germany had a far-right political party entering the federation after World War II.</seg>

<seg id="552">Ten days after the closing ceremony of the 19th NPC, Shanghai released to the public the implementation opinions on further promoting the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="553">In the process of innovation, there are many unsuitable conditions.</seg>
<seg id="554">can thrive with vitality.</seg>
<seg id="555">Enter a new era, science and technology innovation are promising.</seg>
<seg id="556">Located in Shanghai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation is the vanguard of China's satellite technology innovation research.</seg>
<seg id="557">to make a certain thing. In itself, the target choice for this task is new.</seg>
<seg id="558">With the average age of researchers being only 31 years old, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation</seg>
<seg id="559">will also launch five satellites in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="560">From materials and devices to components of all-round innovation, it promotes the upgrade and transformation of China's manufacturing industry chain.</seg>
<seg id="561">In the report of the 19th NPC, it is clearly stated that China has entered into a new era. Personally, the standard of a powerful nation is to take the lead.</seg>
<seg id="562">So far, all satellites launched by our Little Satellite Institute have been groundbreaking, and we will not follow others or chase after others.</seg>
<seg id="563">which comprehensively enhance Shanghai's original innovation capability and out-pace the strategic competence of the world in science and technology innovation and development.</seg>
<seg id="564">Entering into a new era, the strong driving force brought by innovation-driven development to Shanghai is emerging.</seg>
<seg id="565">Braving to try, daring to make breakthrough, self-determination and the enterprising spirit also originate from the fact that Shanghai has always taken institutional reform as the key to developing this great article.</seg>
<seg id="566">The report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC pointed out that to deepen the reform of the science and technology system and establish an innovation system that takes the enterprise as the main body, the market as the orientation and the industry-university-research institute must have deep integration,</seg>
<seg id="567">which is precisely for the reform mechanism to promote innovation and create a better atmosphere for the innovation subject.</seg>
<seg id="568">After the welcoming ceremony, Li Keqiang held the second annual dialog between China and Canada with Trudeau.</seg>
<seg id="569">Li Keqiang made positive comments on the development of Sino-Canadian relations over the past year</seg>
<seg id="570">Li Keqiang said that at present, economic globalization continues to advance. A new round of scientific and technological industrial revolution has swept the globe.</seg>
<seg id="571">To maintain the sound and stable development of Sino-Canadian relations, we must comply with the trend of the times,</seg>
<seg id="572">uphold mutual respect, treat each other equally, seek mutual benefits and win-win cooperation, and constantly expand common interests.</seg>

<seg id="574">Li Keqiang stressed that both China and Canada are important countries in the Asia-Pacific region and significant trade nations in the world, and the positive signals sent by both countries on promoting the liberalization of trade and investment is in the common interests of both sides.</seg>
<seg id="575">The door to China's opening up to the outside world will become larger and larger and the business environment will become better and better. China will continue to be a hot spot for international investment.</seg>
<seg id="576">in the spirit of mutual benefit and reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="577">Canada supports free trade and is ready to work with China to promote globalization and free trade and make its contribution to the sustainable development of the world.</seg>
<seg id="578">Both sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common interest.</seg>
<seg id="579">After the talks, China's premier and the prime minister of Canada witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of education, food safety, and energy.</seg>
<seg id="580">On the afternoon of the 4th, Li Keqiang and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau jointly met with reporters.</seg>
<seg id="581">Li Keqiang introduced the outcome of the second annual ministerial-level dialog between China and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="582">He said both China and Canada unanimously agree to promote the process of globalization and safeguard the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment,and both are ready to work together to explore the feasibility of the FTA.</seg>
<seg id="583">China is open to the process and the content of the negotiation.</seg>
<seg id="584">Both sides agree to step up cooperation in tourism and aviation and to closely promote humanities exchanges between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="585">We share opportunities and welcome challenges together to push forward the Sino-Canadian relations in this golden stage.</seg>
<seg id="586">deepen cooperation in various fields, commit to common development and prosperity, and build a stable and active relationship with China in the medium to long term.</seg>
<seg id="587">Zhang Dejiang, president of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the 4th National Constitution Day Symposium and delivered a speech on the 4th.</seg>
<seg id="588">He emphasized that we need to regard the study and implementation of the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics in a new era of Xi Jinping</seg>
<seg id="589">as the most important task in studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress. It is important to comprehensively implement the major decision making and deployment on strengthening the implementation and supervision of the constitution under the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>
<seg id="135">Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="136">"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.</seg>
<seg id="137">"What else could we do?"</seg>

<seg id="1">On the 9th (Beijing time), Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions it jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday. This was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market.</seg>
<seg id="2">Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, which was also developed jointly with Harman.</seg>
<seg id="4">Samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Samsung also exhibited a “digital cockpit”, which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user’s information from mobile devices and cloud.</seg>

<seg id="2">A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1">January 9 is just a month away from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. As the Olympic torch relay moves north, warm-ups and intense preparations for the Games were carried out. South Korea was warming up for the Winter Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="2">Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”.</seg>
<seg id="7">South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.</seg>
<seg id="8">To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8th that foreigners who visit the country for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days.</seg>

<seg id="2">A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.</seg>
<seg id="3">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.</seg>
<seg id="13">For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.</seg>
<seg id="14">Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="1">Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="2">Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that the production of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="4">While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase. At the same time, they should also be aware that market competition will intensify.</seg>

<seg id="1">July 13 morning Beijing Time. US-based Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="2">The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="1">US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris</seg>
<seg id="2">Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris.</seg>
<seg id="3">A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris.</seg>
<seg id="5">The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit.</seg>
<seg id="6">The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”</seg>
<seg id="7">A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily.</seg>
<seg id="8">The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate.</seg>
<seg id="10">As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="11">The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.</seg>
<seg id="13">At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is.</seg>
<seg id="15">The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="1">The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry, which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas, strong expectations of resumption of production.</seg>
<seg id="2">Although steel plants, as of now, have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended, the industry expects that by around December 15, 2010, steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively. Steel prices could start to come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in Hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time, but in reality, pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some local governments in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas, and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in Hebei have resumed production at this time, and pressure from production quotas have eased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mysteel.com analyst Zhang Tieshan estimated that end-user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China.</seg>
<seg id="7">Coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down, most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15. Products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year’s Day.</seg>

<seg id="1">New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."</seg>

<seg id="7">"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's worth about $1.59 billion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.</seg>

<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation.</seg>
<seg id="2">“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”.</seg>
<seg id="4">Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel, rail transport, shipping vessel, machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general; some have even incurred losses.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected. In the current economic fluctuation however, both high- and low-end industrial products of Northeast China’s traditional industries were affected.</seg>
<seg id="5">A few years ago, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product mix, and gave priority to developing high-end steel plates such as those for containers, railroad tracks, shipbuilding, and civilian home appliances. However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brothers fight over $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."</seg>
<seg id="32">On Friday, that hope appeared gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tourism charm town: How does charm mesmerize tourists</seg>
<seg id="2">[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually unleashed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reputed for Local Custom</seg>
<seg id="5">"Village theatrical performance is staged as the moon rises, while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze."</seg>
<seg id="6">Walking through the Anchang Ancient Town in Shaoxing, you can see hoop buckets, bamboo knitting, ironmaking, shoes stitching, lace making, cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere, which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the Anchang Ancient Town. Tourists all over the world are enchanted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of Shaoxing's historical and cultural experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions.</seg>
<seg id="9">In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2016, the provincial government office issued the "The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.</seg>
<seg id="12">The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Emphasis on promotion</seg>
<seg id="14">Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall.</seg>
<seg id="15">“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.</seg>
<seg id="16">The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important.</seg>
<seg id="22">If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment.</seg>
<seg id="24">This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”.</seg>
<seg id="25">Expecting wonders</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns.</seg>
<seg id="27">As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration.</seg>
<seg id="28">What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.</seg>
<seg id="29">The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well.</seg>
<seg id="31">For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process.</seg>
<seg id="33">Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners.</seg>
<seg id="34">As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>

<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">The opening ceremony of Beijing University of Chemical Technology’s (BUCT) new campus was held at the Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and school officially commenced at the 1,800 mu green campus.</seg>
<seg id="3">Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts.</seg>
<seg id="4">BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Big Fish & Begonia”, an animated feature film 12 years in the making, recently announced that it would be released on July 8th.</seg>
<seg id="3">Liang Xuan, the author of “Big Fish & Begonia”, dropped out of his studies at the Department of Thermal Engineering at Tsinghua University when he was 21, and founded B&T together with best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, Ce Yuan Ventures provided US$1 million in risk investment, kick-starting the maiden animated film, “Big Fish & Begonia”.</seg>
<seg id="4">The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage. It has been included in the Centre Pompidou’s collection and acclaimed as “an outstanding artwork”.</seg>
<seg id="5">As it took six years from creation to production, the film was known as a “super deceiver” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Provence lavender under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020</seg>
<seg id="2">[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.</seg>

<seg id="4">Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority.</seg>
<seg id="11">The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.</seg>
<seg id="12">Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key</seg>
<seg id="13">Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="16">In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending.</seg>
<seg id="17">Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements</seg>
<seg id="23">Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary.</seg>
<seg id="24">Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low.</seg>
<seg id="25">These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,</seg>
<seg id="26">The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel.</seg>
<seg id="30">An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">Consumer groups</seg>
<seg id="32">Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers.</seg>
<seg id="33">A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.</seg>
<seg id="34">In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%.</seg>
<seg id="35">Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small.</seg>
<seg id="36">Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="44">The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.</seg>
<seg id="45">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="46">The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.</seg>
<seg id="49">I can count the scales on its sole.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff</seg>
<seg id="2">At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ....</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;</seg>
<seg id="7">salmon from Iceland, from 10- 12%; and</seg>
<seg id="8">red wine from Georgia and Chile, from 14-30%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Industrial products have benefited as well. For example, import tariffs for some cosmetics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero, while</seg>
<seg id="11">that for some watches have fallen to 50%, and will fall further to zero in a few years’ time;</seg>
<seg id="12">products from South Korea such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40%, and fall further to zero in a few years’ time;</seg>
<seg id="13">and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods.</seg>
<seg id="15">MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods</seg>
<seg id="17">On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!</seg>
<seg id="19">With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="20">The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%.</seg>
<seg id="21">This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.</seg>

<seg id="24">China News Service, December 29</seg>
<seg id="25">US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="26">A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.</seg>
<seg id="27">Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites.</seg>
<seg id="28">In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase.</seg>
<seg id="30">She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.</seg>
<seg id="31">Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly.</seg>
<seg id="35">He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.</seg>
<seg id="36">Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.</seg>
<seg id="37">Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,</seg>
<seg id="38">but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record.</seg>
<seg id="39">Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise.</seg>
<seg id="40">Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,</seg>
<seg id="41">but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;</seg>
<seg id="42">note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="43">The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand.</seg>
<seg id="45">A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior.</seg>
<seg id="46">Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.</seg>
<seg id="47">Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important.</seg>
<seg id="48">Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.</seg>
<seg id="49">No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="50">Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held.</seg>
<seg id="52">Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step.</seg>
<seg id="53">In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="54">With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest.</seg>
<seg id="55">On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="56">Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together.</seg>
<seg id="57">In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation.</seg>
<seg id="58">From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living.</seg>
<seg id="60">Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development.</seg>
<seg id="61">In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion.</seg>
<seg id="62">Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate.</seg>
<seg id="63">Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.</seg>
<seg id="64">Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District.</seg>
<seg id="65">Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved.</seg>
<seg id="66">Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers.</seg>
<seg id="67">A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition.</seg>
<seg id="68">To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="69">Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost</seg>
<seg id="70">RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark.</seg>
<seg id="72">That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="73">Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.</seg>
<seg id="74">Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today.</seg>
<seg id="76">Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009.</seg>
<seg id="77">The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time.</seg>
<seg id="78">From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”.</seg>
<seg id="79">Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor.</seg>
<seg id="80">“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="81">The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.</seg>
<seg id="82">Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday.</seg>
<seg id="83">Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.</seg>
<seg id="84">A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period.</seg>
<seg id="85">Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash.</seg>
<seg id="86">In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times.</seg>
<seg id="87">This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items.</seg>
<seg id="88">Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant.</seg>
<seg id="89">Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="90">Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low.</seg>
<seg id="91">Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.</seg>
<seg id="92">This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”.</seg>
<seg id="93">What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?</seg>
<seg id="94">Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="95">All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?</seg>
<seg id="96">Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="98">This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="99">All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization.</seg>
<seg id="100">In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;</seg>
<seg id="101">the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments.</seg>
<seg id="102">Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world.</seg>
<seg id="103">China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,</seg>
<seg id="104">but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="105">All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?</seg>
<seg id="106">A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="107">Germany is an example.</seg>
<seg id="108">Magical “new retail”</seg>
<seg id="109">Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.</seg>
<seg id="110">In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="111">At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="112">Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account.</seg>
<seg id="113">As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="114">This is because way back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos, in his “Letter to Shareholders”, highlighted that Amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business (such as a physical store) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously:</seg>
<seg id="115">1. We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon;</seg>
<seg id="116">2. we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company;</seg>
<seg id="117">3. we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved; and</seg>
<seg id="118">4. we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="119">Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-sectors, and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="120">When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.</seg>
<seg id="121">Did Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders?</seg>
<seg id="122">Similar words were echoed at the other end of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at The Computing Conference 2016 held in Yunqi, Hangzhou, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said in his keynote address that,</seg>
<seg id="123">“From next year onward, Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘e-commerce’.</seg>
<seg id="124">The era of pure e-commerce firms will soon come to an end. E-commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years, replaced instead by ‘new retail’.</seg>
<seg id="125">Only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being.”</seg>
<seg id="126">In an instant, it was as if the words “new retail” took on magical properties, and became the new catchphrase of industry insiders.</seg>
<seg id="127">So what is “new retail” exactly?</seg>
<seg id="128">If it merely referred to online-offline integration, then the concept is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="129">In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce firms, estimated that total sales of e-commerce firms amounted to approximately US$200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$159 billion;</seg>
<seg id="130">and of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target and Gap).</seg>
<seg id="131">Indeed, Alibaba Group's RMB28.3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Suning Commerce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public.</seg>
<seg id="132">From a global perspective, both retailers and e-commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-channel retail system that encompasses physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.</seg>
<seg id="133">Could Jack Ma’s “new retail” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future?</seg>
<seg id="134">If not, then what is the difference between the multi-channel concept and “new retail”?</seg>
<seg id="135">Perhaps, the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate, but how.</seg>
<seg id="136">A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago; both were focused on price and convenience.</seg>
<seg id="137">On the basis of these two trigger points, e-commerce firms moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, online from offline.</seg>
<seg id="138">As online retail habits formed, and customer experience continued to rise, e-commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories, and began to increase efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="139">In Aliababa CEO Daniel Zhang’s words, “Use the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time, so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met. This will make the entire goods production, circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data.”</seg>
<seg id="140">Thus, the path of e-commerce firms is asset-light on the surface, but asset-heavy in reality.</seg>
<seg id="141">“Light” refers to fixed assets, headcount, management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers; “heavy” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment.</seg>
<seg id="142">Changes in logistical methods ensured the efficiency of e-commerce firms.</seg>
<seg id="143">The Chinese Central Government’s official web portal reported that Premier Li Keqiang presided over the State Council executive meeting held on April 28, which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation.</seg>
<seg id="144">The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="145">The import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from June this year, and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time.</seg>
<seg id="146">Together with the tax reform, consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics will be optimized, with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation, tax rates, and the different parts of the taxation process.</seg>
<seg id="147">More port of entry duty-free shops will be set up and restored, and the variety of duty-free goods will be expanded appropriately, with the value of duty-free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in China.</seg>
<seg id="148">Shopping and customs clearance, as well as tax refund for foreign tourists would expedited, and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law.</seg>
<seg id="149">Policies that support the inspection and quarantine of cross-border e-commerce imports shall be formulated, and unreasonable fees pertaining to imports shall be put in order.</seg>
<seg id="150">The program to promote the brands of Chinese products shall be accelerated, the development of physical stores supported, and online-offline interaction achieved.</seg>
<seg id="151">Market order shall be normalized, and strong measures shall be taken to crack down on counterfeit and shoddy products so that the survival of the fittest will be advanced.</seg>
<seg id="152">Consumers will be able to shop without having to go far, with comfort and ease of mind, and convenience.</seg>
<seg id="153">BlackBerry mobile phones have never been known to wow the crowd with their hardware, but pressure from competition has meant that it has to offer a presentable model. Hence, the Passport was launched last September.</seg>
<seg id="154">SONY would often launch various black technology products. For instance, this flagship-class 4K ultra short throw projector it launched at the beginning of the year was one such example.</seg>
<seg id="155">Naturally, such a high-end, classy, top-grade product comes with a hefty price tag as well. At JPY5 million, equivalent to approximately RMB250,000, it would be enough to buy a car.</seg>
<seg id="156">Big screen luxury TVs have always been the hallmark of technological competence of manufacturers. The multiple award winning LG 77-inch curved OLED 4K Smart TV is a classic example of this type of products.</seg>
<seg id="157">This is not merely a simple fixed angle curved screen TV, but a complex device that allows the user to adjust the curvature according to the user’s position!</seg>
<seg id="158">Based on its 9mm ultra thin display screen, LG has made the curvature of the entire screen difficult to detect with the naked eye, thus achieving maximum variation for a maximum 4000R curvature.</seg>
<seg id="159">Simply press the remote control, and the best angle of the 77-inch screen will move as the user wishes, making it suitable for any viewing scene.</seg>
<seg id="160">Leica’s position in the field of cameras is well known. This Leica T mirrorless camera, launched last year, uses the brand new T mount as the lens mount for the Leica mirrorless camera.</seg>
<seg id="161">In addition to the T mount 23mm fixed and 18-56 zoom lenses launched at the same time, the M-Adapter T allows users of the Leica M series of lenses to attach and use the camera as well.</seg>
<seg id="162">Triumph has accurately grasped the crux of these issues, and developed the new Magic Wire bra.</seg>
<seg id="163">Using silicone, which offers good support, as the underwire, users not only enjoy the comfort of wire-free bras, but also the all-round support of traditional underwired bras.</seg>
<seg id="164">It also comes with a built-in mesh stabilizer that provides more support so that the bra is a perfect fit. It also gives the wearer a cleavage.</seg>
<seg id="165">LG’s home appliances have relatively distinct features these days. RoboSense technology is this CordZero C5 vacuum cleaner’s main feature.</seg>
<seg id="166">The vacuum cleaner is itself a credible machine with maximum suction power of 200 watts. The KOMPRESSER dust compressor technology can compress dust into blocks preventing dust from flying about.</seg>
<seg id="167">The 6500QL has adopted a brand new design concept while maintaining the excellent quality that is customary of 3M products.</seg>
<seg id="168">Its unique cool flow valve can efficiently discharge hot and damp exhaled breath from inside the respirator, allowing easier breathing for users.</seg>
<seg id="169">The all-new quick latch design allows for swift donning and doffing of the respirator with one hand, making it convenient for users who need to don and doff their respirators frequently.</seg>
<seg id="170">A bayonet-style connection may be found on both sides of the respirator to which 3M’s particulate filters and organic vapor cartridges may be connected. Together with the respirator, these can effectively withstand various contaminants in a heavily polluted environment.</seg>
<seg id="171">As a kitchen helper, Intra Eligo has done its best.</seg>
<seg id="172">Nespressor has introduced this reusable capsule made of stainless steel for medical use, which allows the user to easily open and stuff the capsule with coffee powder. After stuffing, close the capsule. Coffee may now be brewed.</seg>
<seg id="173">This daring design has successfully transformed a sensitive medical issue into one that is acceptable by every woman.</seg>
<seg id="174">This model is an improvement over Volvo’s existing safety performance. It carries the latest intersection auto brake system as well as run-off road protection system.</seg>
<seg id="175">Its central touchscreen control panel coupled with Apple Carplay or Android Auto are also further advancement in smart performance.</seg>
<seg id="176">The luxury seven-seater comes with a four-cylinder Drive-E engine is expected to be the choice of many business people.</seg>
<seg id="177">Sold at price starting from RMB828,000, it may be ordered at 4S stores now.</seg>
<seg id="178">As the sole selected Best of the Best product from China, China Airlines’ Premium Business Class cabin design is attractive.</seg>
<seg id="179">Various interior design elements, such as the recreational space, lavatory layout, and seat design are integrated, affording high-end travellers an unforgettable flight experience.</seg>
<seg id="180">Apple Watch finally made its debut at Apple’s Spring conference this March.</seg>
<seg id="181">With a stainless steel case, sapphire crystal glass panel (Ion-X glass for its sports model), it supports an IPX7 rating for water resistance. The watch comes with an in-built heart rate monitor, and uses wireless charging technology.</seg>
<seg id="182">Independent watchmaking concept laboratory MB&F has assembled a team of watchmaking professionals and artists who view the designing and creation of radical timepieces as their mission.</seg>
<seg id="183">On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty eradication summit in Chongqing, and announced that it would explore a new “Internet + Poverty eradication” model to help spur measures targeted at eradicating poverty and revitalize the rural economy.</seg>
<seg id="184">This follows Alibaba’s rural strategy, launch of the Rural Taobao program, online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform, as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund, and is a step-up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="185">Combating and eradicating poverty is presently one of China’s key national strategies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China.</seg>
<seg id="187">“Poverty relief via e-commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development. It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty, advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication, as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet.”</seg>
<seg id="189">As such, Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014, which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="190">In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao program, recruiting “village partners” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward affluence by way of e-commerce.</seg>
<seg id="191">In 2017, Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level poverty-stricken counties.</seg>
<seg id="192">The Alibaba platform has incubated 2118 Taobao Villages,</seg>
<seg id="193">of which close to 400 have emerged in poverty-stricken counties of various provinces, and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken provinces.</seg>
<seg id="194">In 2017, at Alibaba’s China retail platform, nationwide sales of Taobao Villages amounted to RMB120 billion.</seg>
<seg id="195">Daniel Zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative competencies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication.</seg>
<seg id="196">Rural Taobao, in particular, is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-commerce, and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty.</seg>
<seg id="197">At planting phase, Rural Taobao and Ant Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-loans.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2017, of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, 795 were served by Ant Financial Services, which provided convenient payments, credit and other relevant services.</seg>
<seg id="199">Cainiao helped with warehousing and logistics, while Tmall was responsible for selling. Alibaba Cloud’s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production, further raising the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce.</seg>
<seg id="200">The growth in poverty eradication via e-commerce not only requires products, sales channels and industry planning, it also requires talent.</seg>
<seg id="201">By way of the e-commerce courses conducted by Taobao University, Alibaba teaches farmers standardized, quality and large-scale methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of “Poverty relief + Knowledge support” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="202">These courses have already reached approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.</seg>
<seg id="203">The “philanthropic mentality, commercial means” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “genuinely perform poverty relief” when carrying out poverty relief activities.</seg>
<seg id="204">Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma once said that eradicating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief, poverty eradication and becoming affluent.</seg>
<seg id="205">Poverty relief is to give someone a fish; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish; and becoming affluent is to build a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish.</seg>
<seg id="206">Poverty relief through industry development led by e-commerce is building that fish pond.</seg>
<seg id="207">In terms of poverty relief through industry development, Alibaba has partnered Luochuan County in Shaanxi Province to create a Luochuan apple poverty relief through industry development model, which has been replicated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Alibaba’s poverty relief via e-commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers.</seg>
<seg id="209">E-commerce firms, represented by Alibaba, have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels.</seg>
<seg id="210">Some village partners and Ant Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-commerce experience.</seg>
<seg id="211">Currently, the China office of The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has already partnered Rural Taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in Anhui and other areas.</seg>
<seg id="212">Sina Finance news. The “3rd New Economy Think Tank Summit” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Visionary Think Tank Forum was held on January 16. Zhang Li, deputy director of the e-commerce research department at the Ministry of Commerce Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation attended and addressed the Summit.</seg>
<seg id="213">She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues, i.e., those related to the essence and form of globalization, as well as issues associated with phases of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="214">As a result, many believed that globalization has stagnated. Moreover, in the new phase, many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern.</seg>
<seg id="215">The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization. What constrains the intermediate phase of globalization?</seg>
<seg id="216">The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization.</seg>
<seg id="217">Zhang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017. A new growth phase, will begin in 2018, and growth will be driven by producer goods.</seg>
<seg id="218">JD’s first fresh food supermarket 7FRESH officially opened for business recently, and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years.</seg>
<seg id="219">Together with Alibaba’s Hema Supermarket, Yonghui Superstores’ Super Species, Suning’s SUFRESH, Meituan’s Zhangyu Store, and others, “new retail outlets” have begun to emerge in clusters, and have even “challenged” each other on price in this innovative model.</seg>
<seg id="220">The fresh food supermarket war has escalated, and have become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Just what is new in new retail?</seg>
<seg id="221">“We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018, and will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival,”</seg>
<seg id="222">Hema Supermarket CEO Hou Yi revealed the company’s new approach for 2018 at the 2nd New Retail Summit on the 10th.</seg>
<seg id="223">“With effect from 2018, Hema will not merely be a fresh produce e-commerce firm; rather, we will be a general household goods and grocery e-commerce firm that meets consumers’ requirement for prompt delivery service.</seg>
<seg id="224">The core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores, while genuine sales are done online.”</seg>
<seg id="225">Unlike traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Supermarket is, in the eyes of many consumers, a popular Internet store that is fun and has good food. Some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “He district housing” (housing within a 3km radius of a Hema Supermarket).</seg>
<seg id="226">Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and consumers are present at various channels. Therefore, both parties are attempting the multi-channel model.</seg>
<seg id="227">Industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading, more “Hema type” stores will be opened in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="228">Meanwhile, Hema has continued to widen its product scope, expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods. This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year.</seg>
<seg id="229">“For instance, the integrated online-offline business model has attracted consumer eyeballs. Fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses.”</seg>
<seg id="230">“Nonetheless, these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are. At the end of the day, it’s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience. Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill.”</seg>
<seg id="231">As far as RT-Mart’s feiniu.com CEO Yuan Bin is concerned, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed; and shopping requirements have changed as well.</seg>
<seg id="232">Originally, there was a clear demarcation between online and offline; offline wanted to defeat online, and online wanted to counter-attack offline. Now, on the other hand, it’s become a partnership, because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="233">Capital, competing for a slice of the pie, has made the retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, a powder keg.</seg>
<seg id="234">Analysis shows that at present, new retail competition in Tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation, and there is still plenty of Tier 2 cities yet to be explored. Enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market.</seg>
<seg id="235">New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth.</seg>
<seg id="236">CCTV-2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy, CASS have compiled a stack of dry goods, i.e., this weighty annual report on the development of the e-commerce industry in China.</seg>
<seg id="237">What sort of report card did China’s e-commerce industry receive this year?</seg>
<seg id="238">What are the growth trends of the global e-commerce industry?</seg>
<seg id="239">Let us reveal the results one by one.</seg>
<seg id="240">Total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track</seg>
<seg id="241">China’s online retail sales have been sky rocketing since 2006. This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time. Shopping without leaving home; cool!</seg>
<seg id="242">Since 2013 however, the online retail sales growth rate has decelerated from more than 50% to less than 40% for the first time in 2015; in 2016, the growth rate was 26.2%.</seg>
<seg id="243">The situation changed this year, however. Online retail sales accelerated again. For the first nine months of this year, growth rate rebounded to 34.2%,</seg>
<seg id="244">significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016.</seg>
<seg id="245">Perhaps shoppers took a detour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one’s mind and body.</seg>
<seg id="246">In particular, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RMB5.08 trillion, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RMB1.49 trillion.</seg>
<seg id="247">This comprised 13.6% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="248">Wake up, students. It’s time to highlight the key points. Online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor!</seg>
<seg id="249">Elsewhere, per capita online shopping of French netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US$1,925. Goods they purchased online are primarily clothing, worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers.</seg>
<seg id="250">Who says those who love online shopping most must be young?</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="1">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="6">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.</seg>
<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's great feat?</seg>
<seg id="2">Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="3">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="1">On May 18, the Ministry of Finance issued the “Administrative Measures for Special Rewards and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustments of Industrial Enterprises”, and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RMB100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries.</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently, many local governments including that of Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity.</seg>
<seg id="3">In particular, many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces.</seg>
<seg id="4">One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90% of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="5">At an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, Dean of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believed that merely relying on the Central government’s RMB100 billion to “reduce overcapacity” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient. More funds should come from local governments and enterprises. How should that be done?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by Shanxi Province, it was proposed that Shanxi Coking Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company, its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated, and a new business model constructed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy. Earlier, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be resettled as a result of “reducing overcapacity”.</seg>

<seg id="5">During the period when the results were publicly released, the environmental protection office received phone calls, letters, visits and many other forms of feedback from the public concerning such issues, which will be investigated, verified and dealt with by the environmental protection office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="1">The global spree of frigates building If China does not build this type of warships, will it fall behind?</seg>
<seg id="2">With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?</seg>
<seg id="3">With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="4">And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 054A frigates is simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to operate, and doing so can make up for the deficiency of Chinese Navel that has beset the Naval for many years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. With a displacement of 4,000 tons, the warship is equipped with a 76-mm main gun, and shared launching system for 32 HQ-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 YJ-83 anti-ship missiles and 1 Z-9 helicopter. Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today's standard. It can be ranked as medium- to high level frigate among all the frigates in the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century after all. Armaments aside, its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream frigates in the world. Considering that similar frigates in Europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then how should China develop its new frigates? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese navy.</seg>
<seg id="8">The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy, roaming in the vastness of the oceans. It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China’s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force. If necessary, it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So, it seems that the new models of frigates will surely be huge ships that can roam the blue water.</seg>
<seg id="9">Let's look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future rank and file of Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti-submarine and short-range air defense operations. In the amphibious attack group, they should provide protection to ships. According to these requirements, the new frigates must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air defense capability.</seg>
<seg id="11">Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new frigates in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thus, the overall level of the new frigates will edge into the world's top bracket, even comparable to the FFG frigates of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course, these are only the author's conjecture on domestically produced new frigates. Only when the new frigates are launched into the water can we know the truth. Let's anticipate the day.</seg>

<seg id="1">China's household debt ratio is close to the United States. Is being unable to repay loan more frightening than being unable to afford a home?</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently, everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices?</seg>
<seg id="3">However, just when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily published an important commentary once again. Last time we discussed how People’s Daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary. This time, the commentary of People's Daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affordability of housing: can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage?</seg>
<seg id="4">Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan.</seg>
<seg id="5">I. China's growing housing debt crisis</seg>
<seg id="6">The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="8">Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' debts, which is about twice that of business loans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium- and long-term loans.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moreover, the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. In fact, many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends, creating a large amount invisible loans.</seg>
<seg id="11">Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%.</seg>
<seg id="12">Let's make another comparison. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries.</seg>
<seg id="13">The investigation was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%).</seg>
<seg id="15">These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes, the biggest risk of 'Grey Rhinoceros' for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt.</seg>
<seg id="16">2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?</seg>
<seg id="17">As we have analyzed previously, although we have been saying that China’s housing prices are relatively high, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world. So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can replay the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home.</seg>
<seg id="18">A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China’s real estate market hasn't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in Hainan Province as we mentioned before. This is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. However, it's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008, just a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="19">The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long. The stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall, which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most U.S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets. At that time, almost all household assets of the low-income families were real estates, while the majority assets of the top 20% high-income families were financial assets. As a result, poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio.</seg>
<seg id="22">A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans. Thus, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this way, a huge vicious circle formed:</seg>
<seg id="25">“Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can’t repay mortgages – banks sell defaulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ..."</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U.S. financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="28">Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market: Houses are for living, not for speculation. The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks, including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting.</seg>
<seg id="30">For our individual families, we must abandon the mindset of speculating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities. In this way, we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden. A reasonable assessment of one's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth.</seg>

<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="1">Brilliant Metaphors of Xi Jinping about Comprehensively Strengthening Party Discipline</seg>
<seg id="2">During the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech on January 11, emphasizing that “we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline”.</seg>
<seg id="3">With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so let’s review them together!</seg>
<seg id="4">We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time. We should spread the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline to grass-roots party organizations and make every effort to deal with those corruption problems in daily life of the general public.</seg>
<seg id="5">-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China</seg>
<seg id="6">Officials responsible for discipline inspection and supervision at all levels should be loyal and determined, responsible, discipline and law-abiding, honest and upright in order to ensure that the power granted by the Party and the people will not be abused, and the sharp sword used for praising virtue and punishing vice will never be covered by dust.</seg>
<seg id="7">-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China</seg>
<seg id="8">It is impossible to ensure implementation of policies by taking showy and impractical actions and shouting slogans. Without practical actions, we can’t ensure proper implementation of policies only by holding meetings and issuing documents. We must do our works in a practical manner.</seg>
<seg id="9">-- During December 25 and 26, 2017, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the meeting of democratic life held by Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC</seg>
<seg id="10">Our comrades from the Political Bureau should learn about history and be reasonable and must not confuse public and private interests, call white black, blur the boundary between righteousness and benefits or handle issues based on nepotism. You should erect a “wind vane” by taking the lead in adhering to honesty and self-discipline and help establish a work style for the party characterized by honesty and integrity.</seg>
<seg id="11">-- During December 25 and 26, 2017, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the meeting of democratic life held by Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC</seg>
<seg id="12">A person of virtue will attract a group of persons of virtue, so all people will emulate those better than themselves and the action will become a common practice. Personnel appointment serves as the “wind vane”, which will determine the work style of cadres and even the work style of the Party.</seg>
<seg id="13">-- From the speech delivered by Xi Jinping at the National Organization Working Conference on June 28, 2013</seg>
<seg id="14">A blacksmith must have necessary skills in order to do his job in a great way. The Party should unite the people and lead them in fighting great battles, pushing forward great causes and realizing great dreams. We should adhere to and improve the Party’s leadership and make the Party become stronger unswervingly.</seg>
<seg id="15">-- On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out the following during the 19th CPC National Congress</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, the anti-corruption campaign is still facing a complex and challenging situation, so we must be rock-firm determined to consolidate the overwhelming trend and win an overwhelming victory.</seg>
<seg id="17">-- On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out the following during the 19th CPC National Congress</seg>
<seg id="18">During the anti-corruption campaign, we must adhere to the principles of no forbidden zone, full coverage and zero tolerance and should be determined to “fight against tigers”, “beat flies” and “hunt foxes”. The goal of ensuring that officials dare not become corrupt is primarily achieved. The cage used for preventing corruption is getting increasingly secure, and the dam that can block intention of corruption is being built. An overwhelming trend of the anti-corruption campaign takes shape and is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed.</seg>
<seg id="19">-- On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out the following during the 19th CPC National Congress</seg>
<seg id="20">Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in implementing the Codes and Rules, hold the “steering wheel” in exercising power and fasten the “safety belt” for ensuring integrity. In addition, they should also make efforts to eliminate vice and exalt virtue, strengthen resistance against corruption and eliminate evil factors, perform their duties in creating an honest and upright political ecology and make their contributions during the process.</seg>
<seg id="21">-- On March 8, 2017, Xi Jinping emphasized the following during review of the Sichuan Delegation at the 5th session of the 12th National People's Congress</seg>
<seg id="22">The anti-corruption campaign of the CPC isn’t a “Snobbish Shop” that treating different people with different attitudes, or a “House of Cards” characterized by fighting for power and benefit, or an “unfinished building” having a beginning but no end.</seg>
<seg id="23">-- From the speech delivered by Xi Jinping at the 6th plenary session of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China on January 12, 2016</seg>
<seg id="24">To achieve the goal of building a moderately well-off society in an all-round way and realize the Chinese Dream of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, it is key to cultivate and build a cadre team with iron-clad faith, belief, discipline and sense of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="25">-- From the speech delivered by Xi Jinping at National Party School Working Conference on December 11, 2015</seg>
<seg id="26">We should push forward the anti-corruption campaign in an in-depth manner and make great efforts to uproot “rotten trees”, fix “sick trees” and make “crooked trees” become upright in order to alert, warn and caution leading cadres.</seg>
<seg id="27">-- On March 6, 2015, Xi Jinping pointed out the following during review of the Jiangxi Delegation at the 3rd session of the 12th National People's Congress</seg>
<seg id="28">Ideal and belief serve as “calcium” for the spirit of members of the Communist Party, so we must strength ideological and political construction and solve any problem concerning outlook on world, outlook on life and values, which is the “master switch”.</seg>
<seg id="29">-- On January 20, 2014, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the summing-up meeting for the first batch & the deployment meeting for the second batch of educational and practical activities concerning the mass line of the Party</seg>
<seg id="30">We should implement organizational discipline in a practical manner and must not tolerate privilege or exception. Party organizations at all levels should dare to maintain discipline in order to make discipline become an actually live high-voltage line.</seg>
<seg id="31">-- On January 14, 2014, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the 3th plenary session of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China</seg>
<seg id="32">Criticism and self-criticism serve as a good medicine and the actual care given to our comrades and ourselves. Performing criticism and self-criticism needs courage and party spirit, and we must not lose our weapon used for defending ourselves and treating diseases.</seg>
<seg id="33">-- On September 25, 2013, Xi Jinping emphasized the following at the special meeting of democratic life attended by the leading group of the standing committee under the Party committee of Hebei Province</seg>
<seg id="34">We should make efforts to strength restriction and supervision on exercise of power, put power into the cage formed by rules and regulations and establish a punishment mechanism which makes officials dare not to be corrupt, a prevention mechanism which makes officials unable to practice corruption and a safeguard mechanism which makes officials tend to guard against corruption.</seg>

<seg id="2">Neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight. Residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious, and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter.</seg>
<seg id="3">The scientific name for the money tree is “Malabar Chestnut”, a tropical plant native to Mexico. It performs best in warm and damp conditions, and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight, water and nutriments.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers blooming on money trees are rare. It was once said that the “chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yesterday morning, reporters visited the Nanning Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road. Led by Aunt Gao, the reporters saw the money tree.</seg>
<seg id="6">Planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate, the money tree was about five meters tall, and the branch circumference, at its thickest, measured approximately 30 cm. Its leaves were emerald green and luxuriant.</seg>
<seg id="7">The flowers bloomed at tips of higher branches, and the flowers that were in full bloom were more than 10 cm wide. The delicate pale yellow filaments were evenly spread out, and the green buds, when burst, curled backwards on both sides. The fine and dense stamens resembled silver threads with gold stars at their tips.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aunt Gao told the reporters that the money tree has been planted for eight years. When it was first planted, it was about one meter tall; it is now more than five meters tall.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was originally a potted plant when her son first bought it from the flower and bird market, and was subsequently planted in the flower bed. She did not have to take particular care of it, but would occasionally earth it up.</seg>

<seg id="4">In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.</seg>
<seg id="5">Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="6">As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="2">On May 10, environmental protection volunteers loaded rubbish that have been sorted onto trucks.</seg>
<seg id="3">China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention.</seg>

<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>
